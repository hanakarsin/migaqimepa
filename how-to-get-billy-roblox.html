The fully-modeled character was a creation by developer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mPhase</a>, who players often used to create a collection of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">funny TikToks and memes</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, mPhase didn’t comply with the dimensions established by Roblox in the website’s guidelines. Billy was far taller than the default Roblox avatar, which led to its removal as it grew more popular.</p><p>Despite that, smaller UGC developers and even mPhase have brought Billy back through the Avatar Shop, each with their own spin on the smiling stick man. If you want to know how to get Billy, here’s what you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to get Billy in ‘Roblox.'</h2><p>Published on August 21, you can find <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a new Billy model</a> by mPhase on the Avatar Shop as a bundle in Roblox. This new version is free to purchase and customizable with clothing and accessories.</p><p>“Make Billy famous. Wear this bundle so he can explore Roblox!” mPhase wrote for the character's description. “Billy got deleted because he was too skinny. Now he’s back with a new look!”</p><p>mPhase also attached a link to the “Billy Brigade,” a group of like-minded Billy lovers that has amassed over 71,000 followers as of this writing. Thousands of fans have celebrated Billy’s return on social media since mPhase reuploaded the adjusted character.</p><p>“Good news! Very fun design!” said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one player</a> on Twitter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another fan</a> joked that “Billy went to the GYM!! He needed to work on himself before returning” due to how thick the character now looks on the Avatar Store.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Avatar Store in ‘Roblox’ also has a Billy-themed game.</h2><p>Creators besides mPhase have contributed to bringing Billy back in their own way. For instance, one developer is selling a free bundle of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">original Billy’s thin-shaped head</a>.</p><p>And if you want to go more hands-on, a new game by developer Rockndr called “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Test Billy Avatars</a>” lets you play as Billy with others in an empty chat room.</p><p>Judging from how popular the character is, you’re likely to see more interpretations, games, and TikToks based on Billy. He’s not entirely the same, but Billy is more or less back in action but a tad sticker in the arms and legs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGKvqrjLsmSrp5KhvLk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
