"Next was the dinner box with a sausage pan pizza. 6/10 for the pizza nothing special." They then dip a stick of bread into some marinara, writing, "The cheesy bread was good but needs more cheese"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @ilovefriedchikn</span></figure><p>However it seems that the winner of the order was the pizza's garlic sauce, however, as she ranked it a "10/10."
