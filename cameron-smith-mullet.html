He officially started wearing a mullet back in 2021. It was a quarantine cut, in fact. At the Sony Open in Hawaii in January 2021, he discussed how it all happened. "It just come around, I saw a few of the rugby league boys at home doing it," he said during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press conference</a> at the time.</p><p>He continued, "It was a great time to do it during quarantine, just something fun. Make people have a laugh about it. I've just kind of kept it going. I've almost turned it into my good luck charm." Cameron also confirmed that he "absolutely" planned to keep the look.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It also generated a lot of conversation during the Tokoyo Olympics, which were supposed to take place in 2020, but were delayed a year due to the pandemic. Per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Golf News Net</a>, he arrived with "AUS" shaved into the side of his mullet during the men's golf competition. The abbreviation stands for his home country of Australia, which he was excited to represent.</p><p>When asked about the unique detail, he told the outlet: “I mean, it's the Olympics. It doesn't happen too often. I thought I would give Australia a shoutout on the side of the melon. I thought about it for a few weeks beforehand and then I just said, 'Stuff it, I'm going to do it,' and I think it's been received pretty good."</p><p>So far, he has yet to make any comments regarding his hair at the Masters, but we'll keep you updated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6usdGopWarnZ7BqXnMrqOlnaQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
