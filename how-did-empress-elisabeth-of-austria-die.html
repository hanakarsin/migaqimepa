While she stayed at the Hôtel Beau-Rivage, an employee revealed that the Empress of Austria was their guest. On Sept. 10, Elisabeth and her personal assistant, Countess Irma Sztáray de Sztára et Nagymihály, left the hotel to catch the steamer to Montreux.</p><p>As the pair walked along the promenade (without the other members of her entourage, might we add), the then 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them and attempted to look under Elisabeth's umbrella. Once the ship's bell announced its departure, Luigi stabbed the Empress with a sharpened needle file.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Devrim Lingnau as Empress Elisabeth in Netflix's 'The Empress.'</p></figure><p>Following the attack, Elisabeth collapsed. The two women managed to board the ship before Elisabeth passed out. Now, this is when Irma noticed a patch of blood about Elisabeth's left breast — she informed the captain, who swiftly turned the boat back around. Elisabeth was taken back to the Hôtel Beau-Rivage but died before she could receive any medical attention.</p><p>According to an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">autopsy</a>, the weapon penetrated nearly four inches into Elisabeth's thorax, pierced her lung and pericardium, fractured her fourth rib, and punctured her heart from the top.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Luigi Lucheni received a life sentence.</h2><p>Although Luigi assassinated Elisabeth, he originally planned to kill the Duke of Orléans; however, he couldn't find him and instead set his sights upon the Empress of Austria once he learned she was in Geneva.</p><p>"I am an anarchist by conviction," Luigi stated, per the 1899 book Elisabeth, Empress of Austria: A Memoir. "I came to Geneva to kill a sovereign, with object of giving an example to those who suffer and those who do nothing to improve their social position; it did not matter to me who the sovereign was whom I should kill."</p><p>"It was not a woman I struck, but an Empress; it was a crown that I had in view," he concluded.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Eventually, Luigi was caught, and his weapon (which he attempted to get rid of) was found by the hotel concierge. By October of 1898, Luigi was brought before the Geneva Court and demanded that he be tried by the laws of the Canton of Lucerne, which still carried the death penalty. Luigi's request was denied, but in the end, he was sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>In 1900, Luigi attempted to take his own life; by 1910, he died by suicide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecOim2adnaW%2Fpr%2FSZpyloaOWr6bAx2amn2WRqsC1vsiaZJ2hlQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
