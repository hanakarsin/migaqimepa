The soldiers hinted that they were only acting on "orders from above"</p><p>It was gathered that after a few exchange of words with the soldiers, Oshiomhole returned to his office at the governor's house.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, another aircraft meant to convey Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso from his state to Ekiti State, was denied landing rights at the Akure airport, while Rivers State Governor Rotimi Amaechi also suffered the same fate as soldiers stationed between Akure, the capital of Ondo State, and Ado-Ekiti, the capital of Ekiti State, also prevented him from getting to the rally.</p><p>Meanwhile, Governor Murtala Nyako of Adamawa State was also barred from taking off from Yola airport yesterday, to attend the inauguration of the APC executive council in Abuja.</p><p>However, the governor, who attempted to leave the state by road aroused the anger of members of the state assembly who immediately started impeachment proceedings against him. The state's account has been frozen by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.</p><p>Responding to the development in an interview with newsmen, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, accused the Jonathan-led administration of fully militarizing Ekiti State. He condemned that fact that, the federal government had closed down Akure Airport and that soldiers were preventing people from all over Ekiti State from attending a grand rally organized for Governor Fayemi today.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3mAkWxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
