Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has the pedigree and wire withal and had never discriminated against Christians or even a tribe.</p><p>“I am a living example; I am a Christian and I am representing him directly. When it comes to the tribe, I am not from Lagos; I am from Kogi State; so he is the type of person we want.</p><p>“If you talk about religion, if Asiwaju has not Islamised his wife; we don’t see how he can Islamise Nigeria. His wife is not only a Christian; he even allowed the wife to grow to become a pastor.</p><p>“If there is no enabling environment for her in the home she won’t become a pastor. Those are the issues we should talk about. Asiwaju was the one who handed over the missionary school in Lagos to the owners when he came on board, so you can imagine all those issues.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FqZmtoYmh6uLTYZpqhqpmowaqtzaxkrKCfqrmlutNmo6irlWLArbHEqWSorpWneqK8wqxkpq2jobauecyuqqWhnWLBqq%2FKnqtmnpGhsqyxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
