Nigeria would have been on fire if Christian-Christian presidential hopefuls had recruited fake Imams to portray public acceptance.</p><p>“Its failure to mention the names of the hired bishops and the denomination or churches they are from show the grand deception and shenanigan in the whole despicable episode staged by Tinubu and Shettima candidacy which in any event is a combination that divides Nigeria alongside religious lines.</p><p>“The APC and Tinubu support team should stop the dark propaganda. It has failed and pushing it further or justifying the despicable action is condemnable. We challenge Tinubu and Shettima to publish the list of these so-called clerics, their Churches, denominations and exact addresses.</p><p>“Whilst we preach religious tolerance, we frown upon any action that deride another’s faith to score political points. This is devilish and should be rejected by all men and good women of good conscience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FrZp%2BZm5p6o7XSoaapZaSeu7au1GaqoZ2kqbaurYydqZqfl5qxbrLOq2SipqOqubW1zaBkpqGcobawutJmpp9lk52%2Fqr%2FTopinq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
