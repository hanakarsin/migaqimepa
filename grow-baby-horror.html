I mean shelves were filled with so many off-the-wall concepts and playful ideas that any kid walking through a toy store was bound to find the specific toy that spoke to them, no matter how weird.</p><p>For some reason, intentionally ugly and gross toys became a big thing to market to young boys when I was growing up. There was even a major video game release about a janitor-turned-superhero called "Boogerman," who would literally flick boogers and fart.</p><p>The game wasn't great, but it was super duper gross in all the ways that kids love. I remember playing it at a party with my younger brother's friends and they cackled in delight with every nose flick and fart noise. Whoever developed that terrible game knew what they were doing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: youtube</a></figure><p>The thing is though, when you're creating something intentionally gross, it's probably best to let your intended audience know that this is an on-purpose ugly and weird product, without leaving any room for speculation.</p><p>This kind of confusion led to some hilarious results when a Tumblr user shared photos of a "Grow Baby" toy they found and decided to put in water, following the product's instructions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>The 15-hour-long process started delivering results around the 9-hour mark.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>But the birthing process ended up taking a lot longer than 15 hours. The egg finally opened up at the 23-hour mark, and the person who bought it did not like what they saw inside.</p><p>Does this look like a normal baby head to you?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>What emerged from the toy egg wasn't a cute and cuddly baby â€” but rather an infant version of the leprosy dad from Braveheart.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>I mean look at this dude and tell me this baby isn't a dead ringer.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: paramount</span></figure><p>Some people shared their other "baby surprises".</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beautiful <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZvWOraSEiD</a></p>â€” Silverwolf521 (@HolyOrderSeifer) <a href=#>July 6, 2018</a></figure><p>While some noticed that the baby looked very similar to certain public figures.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xsPhGIl40t</a></p>â€” Maria Vale (@MariaValeAuthor) <a href=#>July 7, 2018</a></figure><p>Lots of Twitter users wanted to unsee the disaster that emerged from the egg.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9ofAzEn9vq</a></p>â€” Wolf Mama ðŸ”œ Furrydelphia (@WolfDrawingDesk) <a href=#>July 6, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=pl dir=ltr>Ctrl Z<br>Ctrl Z<br>Ctrl Z<br>*mashes keyboard*</p>â€” X[NOEYES]X (@Duo_Anima) <a href=#>July 6, 2018</a></figure><p>As it turns out though, lots of toys that grow in water for some reason wind up looking busted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ql1ZK2Ywjw</a></p>â€” yucj (@yucj_kh) <a href=#>July 7, 2018</a></figure><p>And if you're still trying to figure out exactly what this baby looks like, "deep fried Buddha Statue" pretty much hits it on the head.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why does the final result look like a deep fried Buddha statue? ðŸ˜‚</p>â€” Sunburst Senshi (@SunburstSenshi) <a href=#>July 7, 2018</a></figure><p>Please, toy manufacturers, if you're going to make a toy really gross, just market it as such to your target demographic.
