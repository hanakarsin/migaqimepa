It almost comes from a place of being playful, so that was cool," Stephan told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>. "Funny enough, you do get a little bit used to it and make connections with people that you never talk to. It was the strangest experience.

Paige got cast in the role of a starfish, an animal that tends to draw slightly less attention with its subtle movements and lack of capacity to make much noise. "Starfish have a ton of nerve endings," she told the New York Post. "So, I was trying to tap into my emotional side and not hold back."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"In the beginning, it was really uncomfortable,” Paige added.
