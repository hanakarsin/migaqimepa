The official creator of the "idiot sandwich," he's been making waves on reality television kitchen shows such as Hell's Kitchen, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, and MasterChef.&nbsp;</p><p>But how much does anyone know about his childhood? While it might seem like he was born fiftysomething and angry, that wasn't always the case.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Gordon Ramsay has three siblings, and they didn't always have the easiest time.</h2><p>From the age of 9, Gordon and his three siblings (an older sister, Diane, a younger brother, Ronnie, and a younger sister, Yvonne) were raised in Stratford-Upon-Avon. He explained in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in-depth article for CNN</a> that his father was frequently abusive, struggling with alcoholism and a revolving door of odd jobs. As a result, the family moved around frequently, and their childhood was not the most stable.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gordon Ramsay (@gordongram)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Initially, Gordon didn't think he was destined for the kitchen, and was interested in a much flashier career choice: professional football player. For the Americans in the room, by 'football,' Gordon means soccer, and at one point, he had aspirations of signing with the Glasgow Rangers. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, Gordon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered an injury to his knee</a>, thus ending his potential athletic career.&nbsp;</p><p>Gordon wasn't the only one who struggled in the years to follow, and he revealed in an interview with Hello! that his brother Ronnie was addicted to heroin. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gordon says</a>, "I don't think there is any easy drug, but when you stoop to the depths of heroin, it's very rare you get back. We've done everything we can to help him." In 2007, Ronnie was jailed in Bali for possession. He spent 10 months in prison prior to his release.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Thankfully, Gordon has a great support system.</h2><p>In 1996, Gordon married schoolteacher Cayetana Elizabeth Hutcheson, and they share four children: Megan, Matilda (known as 'Tilly'), and twins Jack and Holly. The children make frequent appearances on his Instagram, especially Tilly, who seems to have a fondness for TikTok dances. Their youngest child, Oscar, is also a frequent superstar of his Instagram, including adorable pictures of the two together.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gordon Ramsay (@gordongram)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Unfortunately, there was a bit of family trouble that surfaced in 2017, when Gordon's father-in-law Christopher Hutcheson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attempted to hack the business email </a>of Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd. The reason for the hack was to attempt to find blackmail material for use against Gordon, who had a public falling out with his father-in-law after Christopher attempted to hack Gordon Ramsay Holdings Ltd. a first time for financial records and other sensitive information in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, despite the clear successes and highlights of his career, Gordon has definitely had a rough time in life. Thankfully, with his clearly loving family and star continuously on the rise, hopefully 2021 will bring smoother sailing to the Ramsay family. You can catch Gordon on MasterChef US, Hell's Kitchen US, MasterChef Junior, Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch, and Gordon Ramsay's 24 Hours To Hell & Back.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Gordon Ramsay (@gordongram)</a></p></figure><p><strong>If you or someone you know needs help, use SAMHSAâ€™s Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator to find support for mental health and substance use disorders in your area: https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov, or call 1-800-662-4357 for 24-hour assistance.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLyzsM6nZKuZnaiuunnCoaClnJikvKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
