I guess one of the things that comes to mind, is 'let go.' That is where you find the freedom, and in the freedom comes the joy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO Max</span></figure><p><strong>What is your favorite dance in the series?</strong></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>The Water Dance. It is a beautiful piece of art and athleticism.</p><p><strong>As the host and a judge on this series, how do you feel when you have to cut someone from the show and send them home?</strong></p><p><strong>AR: </strong>Sending someone home is the toughest part of the job. Each of our guys gave 100% every day. They really did. And it’s hard to cut someone when they are giving their very best.</p><p><strong>Will fans get to see you dance at all in this series?</strong></p><p><strong>AR</strong>: Nope. I had my time to shine and to be tortured by Alison and Luke, and the results live on film in the movies!</p><p><strong>So, will you possibly be making a cameo in the recently announced film, </strong><strong>Magic Mike 3</strong><strong>?</strong></p><p><strong>AR:</strong> This remains to be seen. I’m always happy to bring Tito back to life.</p><p>Season 1 of Finding Magic Mike is available to stream on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrGiuYyrpp2qmZzCpsaMn6CnnJmjtG65wKCgnGWdnrim</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
