Post-surgery I feel like I’ve been given a new lease on life. I want to say a special thank you to my wife for the love and care, to my fam & friends for their prayers and support, to my many brand partners and employers for their patience and understanding, and to the best surgeon ever, Dr Coker. His entire medical team at Lagoon Hospital I say a big thank you. Grateful to God for the road to divine recovery!”&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49tZqennKHGuLvOnWSam6Skv266wKupmqyVqHq4tMCtZKGho2LEqrLEZpuinF2Ws7Wx0WafnmWTpLqxuMCipZ6cXZavsMHTZpmeoZ6ceqO%2BzqScaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
