According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, it will be on a field that was constructed especially for it next to the diamond where the 1989 movie Field of Dreams was shot in 1989.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The 2021 the Field of Dreams Game will see the iconic baseball teams the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox face off in the first Major League Baseball game to ever take place in Iowa.

Third-party websites have been reportedly reselling the tickets for thousands of dollars. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a tweet</a>, sports writer for USA Today Bob Nightengale said that the tickets are the "the most expensive regular-season tickets on record" according to numbers by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TickPick</a>.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Sun-Times</a>, ticket prices can get even higher than that. It reports that the highest price it's seen on a third-party website is over $4,000, with StubHub having tickets available for $4,400, while the most expensive option on TickPick was $3,972. But the least expensive options were still close to or over $1,000 and, as many of us know, those seats probably aren't going to be the best seats.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you build it, they will come ðŸŒ½</p><p>Tonight, <a href=#>@MLB</a>'s Field of Dreams becomes a reality. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4cDQ82PjkR</a></p>â€” Front Office Sports (@FOS) <a href=#>August 12, 2021</a></figure><p>It doesn't help that the field is only meant to fit 8,000 people in its stands, so there are probably thousands of more people who will have to miss out on seeing the game in person just because there isn't enough space.

If anything, it's probably a better idea to stay at home and stream it from the comfort of your couch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZLCZpJi1bsDHnmSfoZWhsW67xWabq52RosBus8CmnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
