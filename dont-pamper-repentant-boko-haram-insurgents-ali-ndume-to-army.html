And I’m expecting more.</p><p>“It is only that as I have said before, there shouldn’t be blanket amnesty and pampering treatment to those who have surrendered.</p><p>“They should carefully be profiled, and there is no hurry in it. They should be in a hurry to capture and end this war, but not really be in a hurry to talk about this issue of resettlement, reintegration and all that.</p><p>“The first step after getting them is the resettlement of people, now that the war us getting to an end or is almost ending. Then, we talk about profiling, investigating and interrogating those that have surrendered.</p><p>“I think it is a welcome development and I have confidence that more is to be seen with the new leadership and the new cooperation and inter-agency cooperation between our various security agencies.</p><p>“Just as we have been criticising that the armed forces are not doing enough, now that they are doing enough, and there is hope, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, there is a need for Nigerians to come out to support the military by encouraging them, and commending them for what they have done.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5BsZp2nnql6sa3MqZyrZaKavaa605qlrWWSpLiweceaqZqlXZ67tMHRoJynrKNirq21jKebrqWVYsGwecCrpLJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
