I am enjoying it. Luckily for me, he [Paulo Okoye] also doesn’t believe in marriage. We feel like it is overrated.”</p><p>Charly Boy concurred: “I agree with you that marriage is overrated. My son called me the other day and said, ‘Dad, why can’t people have a contract and say we will just do five years in marriage and if we are lucky and happy, we renew the contract?’</p><p>“It sounds funny but you know, there are different coping mechanisms because these days, marriage is not what it used to be when our parents got married. Marriage is a little bit muddled up now. And people are a little bit more individualistic than they used to be before. Nobody wants to serve anybody. Everybody wants to get their own. So, that’s where the problem starts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FvZrCgqWK2brDOp6tmr5GjwW7AzmakmqqirnqxrdSlpmahqZavsHnOo6Zmp6Cau7R51Klm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
