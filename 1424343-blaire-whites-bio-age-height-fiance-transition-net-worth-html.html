Blaire White's life before transition was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">characterized by gender dysphoria</a>, and she was not comfortable being perceived as male.

Rowling. The author <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted a 'joke'</a> that was seen as transphobic among trans and cis people alike.</p><p class=align-left>Blaire claimed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she saw nothing wrong</a> with Rowling’s thoughts and people were just being sensitive.
