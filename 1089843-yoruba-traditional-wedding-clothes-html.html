During the preparation phase for the wedding, the bride, the groom, and their families choose the colors for Aso Ebi – clothes for the guests and the family colour, if the family members want separate colours..</p><p class=align-left>Why is it so important? The family and guests of the bride may be dressed in one color and the family and guests of the groom – in another one. It will help determine the relationships and create a colorful wedding ceremony with juicy vibrant color spots.</p><p class=align-left>The bride’s friends, Ore Iyawo, and the groom’s friends as well receive a privilege of choosing their Aso Ebi for themselves. It’s normal for them to be dressed with more elegance and taste than all the others.

The bride and the groom's clothes are made with the different fabrics, but same colour and the same aso oke. In most cases, the couple's colour is always different from the colours chosen buy their families.</p><h2>Yoruba traditional clothes for groom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkytnrrlp1eje6k.jpeg><p class=align-left>Grooms in Yorualand are usually dressed in Sokoto (quite loose pants), a Buba (a shirt) and Agbada. Agbada is an outfit that’s worn for special festive occasions like weddings and other formal situations. The chest embroidery on Agbada can be utterly elaborate and exquisite.</p><p class=align-left>The attire is accompanied with a hat called Fila. Filas can be of different types and often the groom himself chooses what type of Fila he’s going to wear.
