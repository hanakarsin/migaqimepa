Don’t sit idly expecting me to do everything, take action,” he stated.</p><p>On job creation for the youths, the President while making direct reference to the #EndSARS protests, said youths can’t continue to destroy properties and expect investors to remain in an unsecured environment.</p><p>He told the youths to behave themselves if they want more job opportunities.</p><p>“About 200 buses bought by the former governor of Lagos were burnt by restive youths. Who would go and invest in such an environment? Nobody. It is just common sense.</p><p>”I told them to tell the youths if they want jobs they should behave themselves, make Nigeria secure so that people can come and invest.
