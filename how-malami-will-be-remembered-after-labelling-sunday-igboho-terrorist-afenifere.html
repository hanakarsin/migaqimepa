He disclosed that a 24-member committee set up by President Buhari and headed by him established a link between Igboho and a Boko Haram sponsor, Surajo Muhammad, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United Arab Emirates on charges of financing terrorism.</p><p>Afenifere in a statement issued at the weekend by its national publicity secretary, Comrade <strong>Jare Ajayi</strong>, said the attitude of Malami on matters of rights of Nigerians and the need to use the law to edify the society has always called to question his capacity to hold the exalted office as the first law officer of the country.</p><p>Malami, according to the statement, “will feature prominently because of what he did – and makes the government he serves to do – while in that office.”</p><p>‘’Unfortunately, his prominence would not be for exemplary positive contributions to the nation and to humanity but for the unprecedented damage he caused the administration he served to commit,’’ it said.</p><p>Afenifere stated that to worsen matters for Malami, he could not mention any specific terrorism act carried out by Igboho particularly in regards as the financial transactions he was so excited to roll out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FuZqGnp2K6orjApqBmr5mhuW6uxGapnqWVoq%2BmvsSdZJqepJq%2FbrjAm5ylpJmjtG6%2F1KebmrFdnrSju8eoZK2doqe8s7XSrWSanpWjtqex0Z5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
