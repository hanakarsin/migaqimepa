Since its debut in 2020, Solar Opposites has captured the attention of viewers with its unique blend of humor and social satire. Created by <a href=#>Justin Roiland</a> and Dan Harmon, the animated series quickly established itself as a fan favorite. The show follows a family of aliens who crash-landed on Earth.</p><p>However, there have been major changes to the show’s case. Justin Roiland, who voiced main character Korvo, is no longer a part of the animated series. Now, fans are wondering what went down with Justin and who he has been replaced with.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Korvo's voice change?</h2><p>The change in Korvo’s voice in Solar Opposites was due to a controversial firing. Justin Roiland voiced the popular character since the show’s inception. However, the actor was fired from the role after he was charged with domestic violence. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, the 2020 charges stem from an altercation Justin had with an ex-girlfriend. Per court documents, Justin was charged with domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, and fraud.</p><p>The fallout did not stop there. Justin, who is the co-creator of Rick & Morty, was also axed by Adult Swim. “Adult Swim has ended its association with Justin Roiland,” the company said in a statement. Justin also voiced the two main characters on the show and held various other roles. The show continued without him, and his roles were recast. Amid the scandal, Solar Opposites producers also decided to recast Korvo's voice to continue the show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">After Justin Roiland was fired, who is the new voice of Korvo in ‘Solar Opposites'?</h2><p>In June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu announced</a> Justin Roiland’s replacement. Show producers tapped Dan Stevens to take over the role of the grouchy extraterrestrial, Korvo. Dan has been acting for years, but he is most known for his role as Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey. The U.K. native later expanded his resume with a mix of film and television roles, including his standout performance in the thriller The Guest. Dan also starred as the Beast in Disney's live-action adaptation of Beauty and the Beast.</p><p>Now, Dan is the new voice of Korvo and he has proudly taken over the role. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comicbook.com</a>, Dan suggested that he fell into voice acting but he has since fallen in love with it.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>"I think it's a real gem and I'm such a fan of adult animation," Dan said. "I've always loved doing voiceover and animation, and I've slowly been working my way into that side of the industry. It takes longer than you might think.</p><p>"It doesn't necessarily translate that just because you're in a bunch of TV shows and movies or whatever that you'll just sort of end up in these things.” Dan went on to call voice acting a “passion” of his that he hopes to continue developing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajn6fDsL%2BMr6aim5VisKmtzaCc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
