Plus, Rachel discussed whether a duet with her dad is in the cards.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Terry Bradshaw always encouraged Rachel to sing ‚Äî and they're going to do a duet.</h2><p>Before Rachel graced the small screen on The Bradshaw Bunch, she was living in Nashville and pursuing music. Her love for music came from her dad (who iconically appeared on Season 1 of The Masked Singer).</p><p>"When I was a kid, he and I would sing Patsy Cline‚Äôs song 'Crazy,' and that was our thing since I was a little girl," Rachel shared with Distractify. "He was a huge inspiration for me to keep singing, and that's why I moved to Nashville."</p><p>Because Terry and Rachel are both musically inclined (who can forget his duet with Rob Gronkowski on the fourth episode of The Bradshaw Bunch?) it's a natural fit that they would put out a song together.&nbsp;</p><p>"I asked my dad to do a duet with me for a Christmas song, and that's already been written," she said. "That will be coming out during that season."&nbsp;</p><p>Since Terry wore a deer costume during his stint on The Masked Singer, can we suggest that a cover of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" be done as well?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rachel Bradshaw's new music was inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic.</h2><p>Though Rachel is now clearly focused on her singing and songwriting, she actually filmed The Bradshaw Bunch while she was taking a pause from music.&nbsp;</p><p>"You get burnt out from stuff, and I've been working with music since I was a kid," she told Distractify. "When I came home to take a break, we got the show. It was our new job."</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, all of that changed. The reality star found herself more motivated than ever before to create.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>After taking a couple of years off from the music business I found myself getting completely re-inspired when Covid hit.. somewhere between the ultimate boredom and complete clearing of my head I wrote a whole record by myself just me and the piano.. this is the first song off of my my E.P. Called "Wild Horse" and I would really love if you would pre-save it bc it will be available next week on October 8th !!! Thank you @lelandgrant for producing this bad ass record and to @fordfairchild and his amazing eye for turning music into Insane imagery... you will see my musical journey unfold on this season of #thebradshawbunch ‚ô•Ô∏èüêé LINK IN BIO !!!</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>RACHEL BRADSHAW</a> (@racheltbradshaw) on Oct 2, 2020 at 9:27am PDT</p></figure><p>"Then COVID-19 hit. It was probably two months in when I got to the point where I was losing my mind," she continued. "My old outlet would be to go to my piano, so that's what I did. I just started writing a record and I was like, 'What am I doing right now?'"</p><p>Her single, "Wild Horse," debuted on Oct. 8, and she shared that her EP will likely be out sometime in December of 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>"I was so inspired, and I ended up writing an entire record. When I told my family about it, they told me that I had to release it because they said that it was good, and that it was from my heart. It was really a combination of boredom, and being inspired from COVID. Before that, it had been years since I had been super inspired."</p><p>As for what styles, songs, and sounds she gravitates toward, Rachel noted that The Lumineers, Coldplay, and Lana Del Rey have long been her "go-to's."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rachel shared that the family "would love to" do 'The Bradshaw Bunch' Season 2.</h2><p>Viewers have been loving the mostly family-friendly storylines and the humor featured on The Bradshaw Bunch, and many are hoping that the show will come back for a second season. While E! has yet to officially renew the show, Rachel did say that her family would be excited to continue the show.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"We were all hoping that people would love it ..." Rachel said. "As a family, we are talking to each other daily. Everybody would love to do a Season 2, so we'll see."</p><p>With Lacey and her family potentially relocating to the Texas / Oklahoma area, it seems like the perfect fit for another season.</p><p>The Bradshaw Bunch airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on E!.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66ktMSlZJuqkZnAqa3WZqSuq5mY</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
