Will she fight with Din in 'The Book of Boba Fett'?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: The following article contains spoilers if you haven't caught up on </strong><a href=#><strong>The Mandalorian</strong></a><strong> and </strong><strong>The Book of Boba Fett</strong>.</p><p>The armorer (Emily Swallow) refers to Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) in Episode 5 of <a href=#>The Book of Boba Fett</a> as a "cautionary tale." Why does the armorer speak of a fellow Mandalorian in that manner to <a href=#>Din Djarin</a> (Pedro Pascal)? Could the mention of Bo-Katan's name be teasing her appearance in a future episode of The Book of Boba Fett?</p><p>Bo-Katan made her first live-action appearance (having previously been introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars) in Season 2 of The Mandalorian. Her mission? Recover the <a href=#>Darksaber</a> so she can claim her place as the rightful ruler of the planet Mandalore. However, the situation gets a bit sticky when Din technically becomes the Darksaber's new owner after he beat the previous owner, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) in combat.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Plus</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bo-Katan can't rule Mandalore based on her bloodline alone.</h2><p>As the armorer explains to Din, Bo-Katan's claim to rule Mandalore wasn't rock-solid. Bo-Katan was seen as the rightful ruler of Mandalore by many of her people in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, after the former ruler, Bo-Katan's sister Satine, was murdered by Darth Maul. After proving herself to be a worthy leader in battle, the Darksaber's prior owner, Sabine Wren, gave it to Bo-Katan. Sadly, the Empire destroyed Mandalore after the Darksaber exchange occurred.</p><p>Basically, the armorer somewhat insinuates that Mandalore fell because Bo-Katan wasn't legitimate and lost her way. It makes sense that Bo-Katan rejects Din's offer of the Darksaber in The Mandalorian Season 2 finale. She doesn't want to repeat her past mistake. Instead, Bo-Katan must win the Darksaber from Din in legitimate combat.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Could a Bo-Katan/Din fight happen in 'The Book of Boba Fett'?</h2><p>There are only two episodes left of The Book of Boba Fett. <a href=#>Fennec Shand</a> (Ming-Na Wen) just recruited Din as the muscle Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) needs in his fight against the Pyke Syndicate. Episode 5 also showed us that Din has been struggling to wield the Darksaber properly.</p><p><a href=#>Paz Vizsla</a> (Tait Fletcher) was able to take it away from him during their battle momentarily, and the only way Din gets it back is by besting Paz with a dagger. Thing is, Din wasn't so willing to offer the weapon to Paz.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube/@StarWarsCoffee/@DisneyPlus</span></figure><p>We think that Din is guarding the Darksaber so Bo-Katan can reclaim it in combat. After all, the man doesn't want to rule Mandalore. He just wants to see <a href=#>Baby Yoda</a>!</p><p>In order to be seen as the legitimate ruler of Mandalore, Bo-Katan must best Din in a fight. We think this fight is inevitable, just not in The Book of Boba Fett. As much as we'd love to see Bo-Katan again, her ongoing story arc would make way more sense as a plot point in The Mandalorian Season 3.</p><p>A fight between Mandalorians has to wait for now. Boba's got to finally prove his legitimacy as <a href=#>daimyo of Tatooine</a> once and for all.
