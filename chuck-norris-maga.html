Many Trump devotees who attended the Capitol riots snapped photos with a man who bears a strong resemblance to the martial arts star. But it's not actually him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Folks uploaded pictures of themselves with the man, who was identified as Matthew Bledsoe. It appears that pictures with him were taken some moments before the riots on the Capitol building took place, and many of these snaps were uploaded to folks' Instagram stories, Twitter accounts, and Facebook pages with "Chuck Norris" mentioned somewhere in the caption.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait, so are we just not going to mention the fact that Chuck Norris was at the MAGA insurrection? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aIukJpoCmF</a></p>‚Äî DevinNunesTHEDragQueen (@NunesDrag) <a href=#>January 12, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Saw this on my Facebook today.

Although the two men do bear a resemblance, a quick look at the Walker, Texas Ranger star would succinctly put those rumors to bed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Great now maga is gonna ruin Chuck Norris for me.</p><p>Is nothing sacred anymore üòï</p>‚Äî akaRockDots üåäüåäüê≥üá∫üá∏üê≥üåäüåä (@akaRockDots) <a href=#>January 12, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don't think that's Chuck Norris.</p><p>It doesn't look like any recent photo.</p><p>We'll see.

But that hasn't stopped people from trying to get to the bottom of the MAGA rally accusations.</p><p>A rep for Chuck Norris, Erik Kritzer, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that the actor was not at the protests at the Capitol building. "This is not Chuck Norris and is a wannabe lookalike, although Chuck is much more handsome," he said. "Chuck remains on his range in Texas where he has been with his family."</p><p>However, is Chuck Norris a Trump supporter? People have found comments from the actor that seem to suggest he at least supported Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election bid.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He's MAGA<a href=#>https://t.co/4wItRqIkhF</a></p>‚Äî Liberation Martial Artist ü•ä (@StuffFromSam) <a href=#>January 12, 2021</a></figure><p>NJ.com highlighted Norris' endorsement of Trump in 2016. Although Norris admitted he hadn't seen Trump personally for 42 years, he had positive things to say about him as a person: "I haven't seen or spoken to him since. However, I will tell you, I liked him. He was very friendly and sincere."</p><p>He also penned an op-ed titled, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The People Have Spoken" for WND.com</a>, in which he wrote, "I truly believe that the people who have a negative view of Trump will be pleasantly surprised when he becomes the leader of our country. I also believe he will make positive changes that will benefit the people who need it most."</p><p>While we don't know if Norris still supports Trump, it wasn't him at the riots.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLW2r8pmpaiqop7AbrnAoJg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
