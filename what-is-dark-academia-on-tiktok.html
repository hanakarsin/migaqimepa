One that is incredibly popular among the young adults in the subculture is the 1992 novel The Secret History by Donna Tartt, which centers around students at a private New England college.&nbsp;</p><p>The film adaptations of Black Swan, Bright Young Things, and Kill Your Darlings are inspirations for the look as well.</p><p>Being in accordance with Dark Academia is about more than just fashion.
