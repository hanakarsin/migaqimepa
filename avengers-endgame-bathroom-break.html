Plus, extreme stress brought on by excitement or anxiety will cause the bladder to constrict, and we guarantee this film is going to bring on both emotions in spades. Finally, the pursuit of a guide to help time bathroom breaks is especially hard when you're trying to avoid spoilers. How will you know what moments are OK to miss without some hint that could reveal a critical detail?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When to take pee breaks when you attend “Avengers: Endgame”:</p><p>1.

Jen Ellis, aka @jellispants suggests the following:</p>1) when the San Francisco title card displays &nbsp;2) Hulk has lunch&nbsp;3) when the NJ title card comes upNothing after that and they all occur in the first half<figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter @carterhoff</span></figure><p>Seriously, doing the Lord's work there, Jenn. Unfortunately, the scenes she alludes to are pretty early on. The SF title card occurs 30 minutes in, and unless you're pregnant or have a medical condition, I'm not sure I know what to do with your unprepared ass if this is you.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hulk lunch scene is apparently funny but not integral to the plot and it happens a little more than an hour after the start of the film.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a> offers an even more detailed guide ranking eight viable moments from best to worst.

Your last stop is a scene set in space that apparently goes on forever and isn't too important.&nbsp;</p><p>Most fans agree the real solution is either deprivation or preparation.
