It's a saga that has captivated the online realm, weaving together a rich narrative of curiosity, concern, and, yes, conspiracy theories.</p><p>With the Princess stepping back from the public eye following her abdominal surgery in January 2024, the web transformed into a bustling marketplace of theories. Was she secretly auditioning for <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a>? Or is she letting her hair grow out after a haircut went wrong?</p><p>Here's the internet's take on the "missing" member of the<a href=#> British royal family.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some Kate Middleton conspiracy theories are hilarious.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you've ever spent time on X (formerly Twitter) or <a href=#>TikTok</a>, you likely know that internet folklore can be wild. The public eye has spun a colorful array of conspiracy theories about where Kate Middleton is, many of which are as hilarious as they are imaginative. After all, it had been more than two months before the Princess of Wales made a public appearance in March. So, where exactly is she?</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC News</a>, Kate Middleton has been resting after undergoing abdominal surgery and is expected to make her next public appearance around Easter time, though she resurfaced earlier than expected. Kensington Palace later shared an update via Instagram on Jan. 29, revealing that Kate had returned home. Yet, many people online have reservations regarding these updates.</p><p style=text-align:left>The speculation reached a fever pitch when a Spanish journalist, Concha Calleja, claimed on her TV show to have insider information suggesting that the Princess's condition was far more severe than publicly acknowledged, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Live Mint</a>.</p><p style=text-align:left>Per Concha, Kate was supposedly in grave danger, necessitating her to be placed in a medically-induced coma due to complications arising post-surgery.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My favorite Kate Middleton theory so far is that she got bangs and is waiting for them to grow out üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠</p>‚Äî Taylor üåª (@itsmet_19) <a href=#>February 28, 2024</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: X</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚Äúyeh so basically Kate Middleton hasn‚Äôt been seen in months like she‚Äôs actually missing. word on the conspiracy street is that she‚Äôs doing 1 of many things - gone for a BBL, growing out her bangs, lost at the Wonka experience. also she‚Äôs possibly banksy x‚Äù <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IP20NIKgGl</a></p>‚Äî tiger b (@tiger_brooke) <a href=#>February 28, 2024</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#KateMiddleton</a> trying to keep up with all the conspiracies about her ...<a href=#>#WhereIsKate</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bJ4wVfjHfy</a></p>‚Äî Sarah Z (@Princsss_Sarah) <a href=#>March 1, 2024</a></figure><p>But, not all of the conspiracies are as alarming. A large group of people online believe Kate <a href=#>got a BBL</a>. One of the funnier conspiracy theories about Kate on X is that she "got bangs and is waiting for them to grow out."</p><p>However, not everyone has a lighthearted outlook on her not being in the public eye. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One fan pointed out</a> online that Kate was able to pose outside of the hospital just a few short hours after giving birth, but believes that the British press asking for privacy for the Princess feels like something is off.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When was Kate Middleton's last public appearance?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Kate Middleton with her family at St. Mary Magdalene Church on Dec. 25, 2023.</p></figure><p style=text-align:left>Kate Middleton's last public appearance was on March 4, 2024, riding as passenger in a vehicle being driven by her mother, Carole. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> shared photos of the Princess of Wales in the car, though some still aren't convinced it was actually Kate. It had been more than two months since Kate had been seen in public.</p><p>On Dec. 25, 2023, Kate participated in the royal family's traditional walk to the Christmas Day Services at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham. This event is a long-standing holiday tradition for the royal family.</p><p>During this appearance, Kate, known for her impeccable style, likely participated in the walk alongside other <a href=#>members of the royal family</a>, engaging in the customary greeting of well-wishers who gather outside the church.</p><p>Due to the speculation surrounding Kate's status, Kensington Palace released a statement in February 2024, in an attempt to dispel the conspiracy theories.</p><p>"We were very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales was out until after Easter and Kensington Palace would only be providing updates when something was significant," a spokesperson for the Duchess said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. They went on to reiterate that Kate is "doing well."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Prince and Princess of Wales (@princeandprincessofwales)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kate's photoshopped Mother's Day picture further fueled conspiracy theories.</h2><p>On March 10, 2024, Kate took to Instagram to share a heartwarming Mother's Day photo featuring herself alongside her three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. True to its nature, the internet immediately detected a discrepancy in the photo, particularly with Kate's right hand. Sources such as Reuters and the Associated Press opted to pull the photos, citing that they had been "manipulated."</p><p>The following day, Kate shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X</a> to clear the air, essentially admitting that she had edited the photo. Kate wrote, "Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother‚Äôs Day."</p><p>Will this be enough to put the rumors and conspiracy theories to rest?
