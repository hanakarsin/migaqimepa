The committee was said to have picked the Rivers helmsman, who came second during the party’s presidential primaries, but Atiku opted for Okowa.</p><p>Due to the development, some of the aggrieved members had reportedly threatened defection.</p><p>Speaking, however, on what seems to be a major crack in the opposition party ahead of the 2023 elections, Ortom told newsmen on Thursday (today) that all aggrieved members have resolved to remain with the party.</p><p>Ortom said he met with the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Seyi Makinde</strong> </a>of Oyo State and others over the differences in the party ahead of the 2023 general elections and that they are all in for PDP.</p><p>He explained that Atiku reached out to him personally to pacify Governor Wike over the issues.</p><p>Ortom expressed optimism that Wike would be pacified and work with Atiku towards ensuring the party returns to power in 2023.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the Benue State Governor made the disclosure while appearing live on Arise TV on Thursday.</p><p>Ortom recounted how Wike stood by him when Benue State was under siege by Fulani herders.</p><p>He said: “Efforts are on to resolve the crisis in the party. Our presidential candidate has reached out to me to pacify Wike. Wike stood with me at my worst time when my state was under siege.</p><p>“I believe working with Wike will help get a better result.
