We are not sure if this is linked to his resent constant dragging FBI online in regards to fraud cases which involves Hushpuppi and Abba Kyari or his other misconducts. But the bottom line is that, Israel DMW is no longer Davido’s logistics manager or a member of his team. Anyone who does business with him should note that Whatever business they engage in has nothing to do with Mr David Adeleke or the “DAVIDO” brand.
