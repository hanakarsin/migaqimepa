I don’t want to compromise my happiness for anything."</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Sarah Kester</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Published July 20 2024, 5:00 a.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @tessa_blanchard</a></figure><p>The last time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tessa Blanchard’s</a> name was in the headlines, she was wrestling with the fallout of being canceled. This took place in 2020 when the now-28-year-old <a href=#>TNA wrestler</a> was accused of making belittling and racist remarks toward other female wrestlers in the industry.</p><p>Before her cancellation, Tessa’s career was on a meteoric rise, having been the first woman to win the Impact World Championship title.</p><p>This begs the question: How is Tessa Blanchard now? Here’s a look at her life post-cancellation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">First, a refresher on what ruined Tessa Blanchard’s promising wrestling career.</h2><p>The controversy that took down Tessa’s career started when she wrote a tweet encouraging women to support other women. But since some believed her tweet was condescending, it opened the floodgates for a sea of backlash.</p><p>This resulted in several women in pro wrestling accusing Tessa of bullying other females in a belittling and racist manner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram | @tessa_blanchard</a></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, some of Tessa’s alleged victims included ​​WWE NXT Superstar Chelsea Green, NWA world women’s champion Allysin Kay, and former Impact Wrestling star Tanea Brooks.</p><p>Chelsea, for example, accused Tessa of belittling “countless female workers.” Allysin was the one who claimed that Tessa was a racist. She said that Tessa “spat in a black woman’s face in Japan and called her the N-word.”</p><p>Despite the controversy, Tessa persevered forward and managed to win the Impact World Championship title.</p><p>She marked history as the first woman to win the title. However, due to the serious allegations surrounding her, Tessa’s standing in the company was on fragile ground.</p><p>Around this time, the COVID-19 pandemic caused Tessa to miss appearances on Impact TV. Instead, she relocated to Mexico with her partner, a fellow wrestler who is known as Daga. She was supposed to defend her title in July 2020 for the pay-per-view event Slammiversary.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by TESSA BLANCHARD (@tessa_blanchard)</a></p></figure><p>However, tensions finally boiled over between Tessa and Impact Wrestling when she didn’t submit her promotion for a segment. Tessa was ultimately stripped of her title, and her contract with the company was terminated.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Tessa Blanchard doing now?</h2><p>Tessa may have been down, but she’s starting to get back up. The former Impact World Champion has gotten back into the ring several times. This includes a Hurricane Pro Wrestling Event and an event for Pennsylvania Premiere Wrestling.</p><p>When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a> told her in a 2022 interview that fans have lost track of what she’s up to, she said, “I kind of do that on purpose. I like to keep some things for me, some things for my family.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Esfinge oficial cmll (@esfingecmll_oficial)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tessa Blanchard revealed that she was also enrolled in studies at the University of Texas.</h2><p>“Right now, I’m in school …. that’s my main focus right now. I try to do one or two of the wrestling get-togethers or matches a month. Honestly, not too much more than that at the moment,” she explained in her Sportskeeda interview.</p><p>She went on to say that her main focus is being happy: “That’s really my main focus right now, my happiness.
