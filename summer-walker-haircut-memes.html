She had just divorced from ex-husband <a href=#>Kevin Federline</a> and was struggling with her mental health as the paparazzi bombarded her everywhere she went. In February 2007, she checked into rehab for a day, only to check out the following morning, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>After leaving rehab, she went to Kevin's home and asked to see their two sons. He refused and Britney drove to a nearby hair salon and asked the hairdresser to shave her head. As noted in the 2019 documentary Britney Spears: Breaking Point, the hairdresser tried to persuade Britney not to go through with it. However, when the hairdresser turned her back for a second, she grabbed the clippers and shaved her head by herself.</p><p>Later that night, Britney went to a tattoo parlor and started confiding in tattoo artist Emily Wynee-Hughes.</p><p>"I noticed her hair was gone. I remember asking her, 'Why did you shave your head?'" Emily said in the documentary. "It was, you know, 'I just don't want anybody, anybody touching my head. I don't want anyone touching my hair. I'm sick of people touching my hair," she recalled the mom of two telling her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Britney Spears' dad is going to put Summer Walker under conservatorship if she's not careful.</p>‚Äî Nick (@cant_log_off) <a href=#>February 2, 2022</a></figure><p>While Summer Walker may have a lot on her plate right now, there is currently no evidence supporting the claim that she shaved her head as a way of coping during a difficult time.</p><p>And although many fans poked fun at Summer's new look, a few remained loyal. "If she like it, I love it," one fan wrote in the comments of a post that The Jasmine Brand shared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.
