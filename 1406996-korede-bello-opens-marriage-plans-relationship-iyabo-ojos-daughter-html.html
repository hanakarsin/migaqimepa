If I could turn back the hands of time there're a lot of things I would love to change but I guess there's a reason we can't do that because what will be will eventuality find a way of being. I might not be able to change the past but I can still influence the timeline by taking actions in the present that can change the future.

I had just introduced my fans to the newly rebranded Korede Bello but Covid hit before we could hit the road. So we had to strategize and that's when I came up with Micasa Sucasa, which literally means 'my house is your house'. With the help of TikTok, I was able to target a global virtual audience.”<p class=align-left>Bello also has a newfound initiative called KBI which focuses on mental health, especially for celebrities.</p>"It was established when I realised that it doesn't matter how much money or fame you acquire, you need good health to enjoy it.
