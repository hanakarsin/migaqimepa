What happened for the bot to get to this state? We've got all the answers here.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Pokemon Company</span></figure><p>If you're an avid Discord user, chances are you've at least heard of the bot <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokecord</a>. The creative addition to the popular chat client allowed users to invite a bot to their servers to help run a game of <a href=#>Pokemon</a> right within Discord. Of course, it was only a rudimentary facsimile of the games, but it was still cool â€“&nbsp;and a fun way to spend time together across channels while getting to know server members and chatting about different topics. Now, unfortunately, Pokecord is no more.</p><p>Pokecord was one of the largest Discord bots available, used by millions of players. It had been implemented on nearly 1.3 million servers, meaning plenty of players had decided it was cool enough to use on their own personal chat channels. Where did it go and why did it disappear if it was so popular? We've got all the answers to your burning questions, so grab a Poke Ball, chill out, and let's get into it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Pokecord</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where did Pokecord go and why?</h2><p>Pokecord was cut down in its prime by its very creator, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miles</a>. As it turns out, Miles wrote a heartfelt letter to the loyal Pokecord community in a bid to explain his decision and how he felt about it at the time. In a message posted to the official Pokecord Discord, he opened up to readers.</p><p>"It's been a wild ride, going from a project I used to learn to code to one of the biggest bots on Discord used by millions of people in almost 1.3 million servers," Miles wrote. "For this I'd like to give a huge thank you to everyone who made it possible by playing and sharing the bot with their friends."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Pokecord</span></figure><p>"Unfortunately this unexpected growth also comes with a lot of added work and stress, and after two and a half years of maintaining and updating the bot, it's with a heavy heart that I've decided to bring it to an end and move on to other projects," Miles continued. He thanked users for coming along on the journey and noted that the Pokecord email would remain active until July 1. Unfortunately, it appears the burden of running Pokecord was just too hard to continue with.&nbsp;</p><p>It's definitely a shame, because Pokecord served a very fun purpose that many players engaged with often. It doesn't look like there's anything particularly similar to it right now to replace it, so the Discord community will definitely be suffering a loss. It's unclear yet if possibly Miles would be amenable for someone to come in and take over or if this really is the end. Hopefully someone is able to take over so we can still have the app.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Pokecord</span></figure><p>It's definitely a bummer, but running projects like this can take a toll on anyone. Here's to celebrating Pokecord for all the fun it gave us and all the time we still have left for it while we do. In the meantime, at least we still have major Pokemon titles!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSpp5uasLC%2Bww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
