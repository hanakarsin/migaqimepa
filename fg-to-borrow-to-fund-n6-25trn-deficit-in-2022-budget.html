But if you look at the total size of the borrowing, it is still within healthy and sustainable limits.</p><p>“As of July 2021, the total borrowing is 23 percent of GDP. When you compare it to other countries, we are the lowest within the region, lowest compared to Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and Angola.</p><p>“We do have a problem with revenue. Our revenues have been increasing. We just reported to the council that our revenues from non-oil have performed (as of July) at the rate of 111 percent, which means outperforming the prorated budget.</p><p>“But our expenditure, especially staff emoluments have been increasing at a very fast rate making it difficult to cope with funding of government.</p><p>“So, what we have to do is a combination of cutting down our cost, as well as increasing revenue to be able to cope with all that is required for the government to do, including salaries, pensions debt service, as well as capital expenditure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49wZp%2BfXam8bq7Oq6mor12pvG6y1KebZqZmYn92wNGnZJ2dlp6wqsCMoqVmamBnf26u1J2enqxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
