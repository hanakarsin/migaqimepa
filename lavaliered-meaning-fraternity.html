If you‚Äôve attended a historically Black college or university (HBCU) or a <a href=#>predominantly white institution (PWI)</a>, Greek life is usually alive and well with hopefuls yearning for a spot with an organization.</p><p>That said, it has always been believed that joining a fraternity or a sorority is a solo mission. Sure, you have brothers or sisters who go through a process with you, but it‚Äôs all pretty secretive ‚Äî meaning divulging information to a loved one or significant other is a no-go. However, some fraternities have a process that includes your significant other. It's time to get acquainted with being lavaliered.</p><p>In a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video, one woman shared some aspects of her experience being lavaliered into her boyfriend‚Äôs fraternity, and social media users are intrigued to know exactly what that process means. Here‚Äôs the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@fitnessbyanni</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman shared her lavaliered experience online and highlighted exactly what it means.</h2><p>Welcome to the family! In an Oct. 1, 2023, TikTok video, creator Annika (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@fitnessbyanni</a>) shared a video where she showed the buildup of being lavaliered into her boyfriend‚Äôs fraternity.</p><p>‚ÄúTake your guess as to whether or not I‚Äôm a brother now,‚Äù the video caption reads.</p><p>As the video starts, Annika is seen wearing a white dress and makeup as a text overlay reads, ‚ÄúAm I getting lavaliered or did he just tell me to put on a dress and heels?‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@fitnessbyanni href=#>@fitnessbyanni</a><p>take your guess as to whether or not I‚Äôm a brother now</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Steven Johnson" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Steven Johnson</a></figure><p>The video showed Annika questioning things once she saw her boyfriend in a suit, all of his frat brothers who are his roommates being gone, and the boyfriend driving her to the frat house.</p><p>In a follow-up video, Annika and her boyfriend are seen exiting his frat house as people gather around outside. In another video, she shared photos of her and her boyfriend posing outside of the Indiana Gamma chapter of Phi Delta house after being lavaliered.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@fitnessbyanni href=#>@fitnessbyanni</a><p>Replying to @Aeriel &lt;3 the update you‚Äôve all been waiting for‚Ä¶ü§≠</p><a title="‚ô¨ September - Earth, Wind & Fire" href=#>‚ô¨ September - Earth, Wind & Fire</a></figure><p>After tons of questions about the process, Annika finally shared a video explaining what it means to be lavaliered. According to her, being lavaliered into a fraternity entails a long-term girlfriend (with whom the brother sees marriage in the future) of one of the senior brothers in the frat being recognized as an honorary brother of the frat.</p><p>Annika explained that the process is different based on the school and the fraternity. However, her boyfriend decided that he wanted to lavalier her into the fraternity and had a meeting with his brothers about it. All the brothers had to give their consent to her becoming a part of the organization.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@fitnessbyanni href=#>@fitnessbyanni</a><p>Replying to @Madison Ward this is definitely a more old school tradition!

Additionally, a boyfriend belonging to a fraternity that has the lavaliered process is essentially sharing his brotherhood with his partner with the promise of a bond that lasts forever.</p><p>So, other ladies who have been lavaliered congratulated Annika on receiving the honor while also sharing their own experiences.</p><p>‚ÄúI was lavaliered and pinned in college.
