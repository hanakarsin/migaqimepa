The viral clip, which has amassed over 1.8 million views, reveals the TikToker managed to fit a pack of cards, deodorant, a portable speaker, passports, a bikini, and a gym kit in the pockets.</p><p>"The best pocket is on the back," the TikToker (known as Chelsea) claimed before her friend stuffed a MacBook in the compartment. Chelsea revealed she felt confident that the fishing vest hack would work and lucky for her, it did!

Life changing," one person penned.</p><p>Another wrote, "I spent so long looking for a travel jacket with tons of pockets, I don't know why I never thought of this!" A third TikToker said, "My friend always wears her denim jacket as it's got so many pockets on it to store stuff."</p><p>TikTok user @oneanswer4u revealed, "There's actually a company out there that already makes that specifically for travel.

If you're wondering why, it's because she's obsessed with vests and wears them all the time.</p><p>Many asked Chelsea what it was like going through security, as they usually make travelers take off extra layers and unpack everything. She replied, "At security, you put your jackets in a tray — you only remove liquids and laptops (or similar items). You don't need to unpack pockets."</p><p>A few others asked her if she wore the vest the whole flight — she didn't. Chelsea said she "popped it in the overhead with my coat once everyone had put their bags up!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@dance.likenooneswatching href=#>@dance.likenooneswatching</a><p>Will this packing hack work?
