Other revelations include the fact that he paid no income taxes at all for 10 of the past 15 years as well as evidence of massive amounts of debt that he will not likely be able to pay off in the next few years when it's due.</p><p>Trump was the first president not to disclose his tax returns while campaigning for the job, and although many have suspected the reason for that was that his finances were messy beyond belief, we didn't have confirmation of that until now.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter found that "$750" number particularly despicable. Many people who make far less than the millionaire real estate mogul turned reality TV star turned president pay much more than $750 in taxes every year, prohibitive amounts that measure in the thousands.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that Donald Trump and other members of the mega-wealthy class can loophole their way out of paying their fair share while the rest of us drown points to a totally broken system, one that people hope to dismantle by sharing their own stories. These tweets demonstrate just how ludicrous it is that Donald Trump got away with only paying $750 in taxes in a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I run a small business that has never made more than six figures annually.</p><p>Trump paid $750 in taxes in 2017.

McLaughlin ðŸ©¸ðŸ¦· (@ECMcLaughlin) <a href=#>September 27, 2020</a></figure><p>This small business owner paid 225 times more in federal taxes than Donald Trump did in 2016 and 2017. When I was a freelancer scraping up a meager five figures, I owed about $6,000 in taxes for one year. The experience of paying taxes as a freelancer really opened by eyes to the inequality in our system.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>As an undocumented immigrant, I can now say that I've paid more in taxes than the President. According to NYT, <a href=#>@realDonaldTrump</a> paid only "$750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency."</p><p>Meanwhile, I paid $1,559.85 in *quarterly taxes* for Q4 '19.<a href=#>#TrumpTaxReturns</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6D3m9qPhK0</a></p>â€” Rodrigo P. Pimentel (@rdrigopimentel) <a href=#>September 27, 2020</a></figure><p>Rodrigo isn't the only undocumented immigrant to pay more in taxes than the president. A viral tweet from comedian Chris Garcia explains the stark discrepancy between their contributions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In 2017, Trump paid $750 in taxes. That same year undocumented immigrants paid over 27 Billion. Remind me, whoâ€™s the burden on the economy?</p>â€” Chris Garcia (@_chrisgarcia) <a href=#>September 27, 2020</a></figure><p>Lots of conservatives like to say that undocumented immigrants are a "burden on the economy" even though they contribute billions in taxes each year. Meanwhile, a man with several gold toilets is refusing to pay his fair share and draining resources in the process.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am a 16-year-old part-time minimum wage worker and I pay more income taxes than the billionaire President of the United States</p>â€” Calla (@CallaWalsh) <a href=#>September 27, 2020</a></figure><p>Even a teenager with a part-time job pays more in taxes than the President of the United States. But she is far from the youngest one who commented on this absurdity.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am 9 years old.<br>I have paid more taxes than Donald Trump. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EwlsCz3oXs</a></p>â€” Havana Chapman-Edwards (@TheTinyDiplomat) <a href=#>September 28, 2020</a></figure><p>Havana is 9 years old and has paid more in taxes than Donald Trump. Taxes are a positive thing. They help the country run smoothly, build infrastructure, and provide services for its people. But the system is broken when a child has to pay more than a multi-millionaire TV star.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When my son was 8 months old, he was in a movie for 3 minutes.

Let that sink in.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My taxable income in 2017 was around $55,000.

Donald Trump is just a symptom of a much larger, structural issue. Our tax system isn't fair. It doesn't work for the vast majority of people.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Abraham Lincoln paid 3x more in taxes in 1864 than Donald Trump in 2016. Not more as a share of his income. More in taxes. Lincoln paid $1981.67 in federal taxes on a salary of $25,000 in 1864-1865. Trump paid $750 in 2016, about one-third what Lincoln paid, but 151 years later.</p>â€” Brad Simpson (@bradleyrsimpson) <a href=#>September 28, 2020</a></figure><p>If you need a little perspective, Abraham Lincoln literally paid more dollars than Donald Trump in taxes when he was president...150 years ago. These numbers aren't adjusted for inflation. They are the actual numbers.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Federal taxes paid, first year in office</p><p>Ronald Reagan: $165,202<br>George H.W.

Every single president for the last 40 years has paid tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even over a million dollars in federal taxes during their first year. Donald Trump? $750. $750. I can't repeat it enough. $750.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyvrcudZK2qpaK9brXNnKamnV2prrmx0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
