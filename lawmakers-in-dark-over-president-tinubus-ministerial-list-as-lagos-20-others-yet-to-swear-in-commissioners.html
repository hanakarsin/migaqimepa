I am not speaking to you as an authority because I am not a spokesperson but I am not aware of the arrival of the list to the Senate.</p><p>“The Senate’s closed-door meeting has nothing to do with the ministerial list as reported; rather it was due to other issues. The report of the Senate discussing ministerial list in a closed-door session is fake and misleading.”</p><p>Also, an APC lawmaker in the South-West, who begged for anonymity, said that he could not tell at what junction the ministerial list was but was confident that the Senate would accommodate it whenever it got delivered here.</p><p>The Senator said, “I don’t know anything about the list. It may get here towards the end of the month. But sincerely, I know nothing about it, and since I don’t have an interest in it, there is nothing to be eager about. Whenever the list gets here, the Senate would consider and screen them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FrZqWZp6KurLHRrGSipl2ZrrO3jKitnqpdpb%2Bmv8idnKesXam2r8HBrqpmpZmjtrTAxKugmqRdoba0wIyaqmakkZy8tHmRaWSorJiav7R52J6rZqyfYsC4scCrZKKmXZi8rrnIrKqip56av7R7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
