Season two was a TOTAL DISASTER...Sometimes I sit back and ask myself what was the intention of this show, what was the original idea???...And then I remember the MAIN REASON. I was actually really looking for a wife to marry, settle with and start a family, then things happened and that's life, but the best thing about life is that it offers us the opportunity to REFOCUS, to remember why we do what we do and why we began whatever we began in the first place,'' Eric wrote on IG.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/47810bf111a9b25e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Talifhani Banks: Young Entrepreneur Overjoyed after Employing Dad In His Company</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He went on to promise his followers that he will be honest this time round and honour his word by marrying the winner of his reality show.</p><p class=align-left>According to<a href=#> the comedian's post</a>, he is currently tired and wants to get his better half, start a <a href=#>family</a> and enjoy his happily ever after with his wife and later, his children.</p><p class=align-left>Eric confirmed season three of his show will premiere soon and that it will feature 'candidates' from countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia, South Sudan and <a href=#>Nigeria</a>.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>The comedian</a> noted that he will be turning 40 in about nine months, therefore, needs to settle down.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <i><a href=#>Click 'See First' under 'Follow' Tab to see Tuko.co.ke news on your FB feed</a></i></strong></p>''I want to PROMISE YOU one thing as my FAMILY, FRIENDS and FANS.
