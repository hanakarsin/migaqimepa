The alleged plan to remove Prof. Mahmood Yakubu and top officials of INEC is a no-go area. The political parties in the country will not accept it. This alleged plot has been coordinated by some APC chieftains and Governors led by a controversial South-East APC Governor. If this plot is not crushed, it can discredit our election and throw Nigeria into crisis. Our institution can’t be destroyed for one man’s quest or a group of people to keep what was hijacked from the people.”</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel=noopener>INEC has earlier announced the removal of 2.7 million</a> voters from its database over double and invalid voter registrations.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Naija News</strong></a> reported that the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, stated this on Tuesday at the National Endowment for Democracy event in the United States.</p><p>Yakubu disclosed that the electoral agency has conducted a comprehensive clean-up of the registration data using the automated biometric identification system (ABIS).</p><p>He said following the suspension of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, INEC removed those who registered twice, those who are underage, and those who had no reason to register as provided by law.</p><p>He said: “Many citizens seized the opportunity for the online pre-registration during the period of one year between June 2021 and June 2022. Similarly, the physical registration continued simultaneously with the online registration for a period of one year including a one-month extension in response to appeals by citizens.</p><p>“At the end of the exercise, 12,298,944 citizens completed their registration. This is more than the entire voter population in the republic of Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Cape Verde.</p><p>“We have completed the cleaning up of the data using the automated biometric identification system (ABIS) — those who registered twice, those who are underage, and those who had no reason to register as provided by law have been weeded out.</p><p>“This exercise has been completed a few days ago and we have 2.7 million invalid registrants that were weeded out. We’ll continue to take whatever step is necessary to protect the integrity of the register of voters because it is fundamental to the conduct of credible elections.”</p><p>Speaking further, Yakubu said new Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) would be made available by November, adding that about 50% of the new PVCs are ready but yet to be distributed to collection centres.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BrZpynkaG2tbXOp2SrmZmosrR5wKWYq6VdpLturculnKCdlGK9rbvTZquoZaKaurDCxGagp52TYrCprcirpJqmXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
