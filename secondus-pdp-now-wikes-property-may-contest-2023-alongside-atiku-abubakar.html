Gbasam of the State High Court sitting in Degema LGA said that the suspension remains pending the hearing and determination of motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.</p><p>Reacting, the chieftain of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, Olusegun Bamgbose said Wike has succeeded in kidnapping the PDP.</p><p>According to Bamgbose, the ruling has reduced the PDP to a regional party.</p><p>The presidential hopeful disclosed that the Rivers governor may be plotting to contest the 2023 presidency alongside former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>“Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has succeeded in hijacking the party structure and thus become the most powerful member of the party as of today,” he told Daily Post.</p><p>“It’s most unfortunate that one who was never a founding member of the party has now taken over the structure of the party. One wonders why Atiku Abubakar should pay homage to Wike in order to pave the way for him to clinch the party’s ticket.</p><p>“One won’t be surprised if Wike will eventually be running mate to Atiku come 2023. PDP has lost its opposition status and NNPP will certainly take over.”</p><p>According to the lawyer, the main opposition party had not shown it is capable of wrestling power from the APC in 2023.</p><p>He stated that the PDP has now become a limited liability company whereby “Governor Wike has emerged as Managing Director of the PLC. This is sad, party-turned-company.”</p><p>“Atiku’s intervention is too late in the day. Those visualizing PDP to take over from APC come 2023 should be seen as daydreamers,” Bamgbose said.</p><p>“They are very far from reality. Nigerians must switch over to New Nigeria People’s Party, NNPP. We are very confident that it is the best alternative to take over power from APC come 2023.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FvZqydk6S7pcHSZqedqF2jvLh51qKinqtdpb%2BwvMSrq7JlnZbGbq%2FOp6ueq6Rif3F%2BkmaYpaeenMCqsMRmmK2hm6p6oq7Um5ikmaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
