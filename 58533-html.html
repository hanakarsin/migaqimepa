The kid or kids also need a man, either their father or stepfather, someone to tell them you are my daughter, you are my son and I don’t want this or that. It’s true that being single is so sweet and interesting but as a woman a time will come when age will tell and the whole thing will clear off.</i></p><p><i>If you want to remain single or something, it will get to a stage that loneliness will set in because by that time the children would have grown and gone. In my own case, I don’t love to be a single mother, so I will surely settle down with a man, it’s just the time so I won’t rush out when I go in. If you think you want to remain single because of the freedom you enjoy, the freedom will turn to another thing when the time comes.</i></p><p><i>On if she would get married this year</i>&nbsp; <i>"If God says so, no problem but there are no plans for that now. I believe there is time for everything and I am an advocate of being happy always".</i> <i>So I am happy right now and when the time comes for that I won’t hesitate to embrace it and be happy.</i></p><p><strong>On the effect the changes of her conversion to Islam has had on her</strong></p><p><i>Let me start like this, people have been saying different things since they learnt I went to Hajj, but the issue is that I also have a Muslim background because my mum was a Muslim. Besides, whoever have seen me go worship in a church&nbsp;in the last fifteen years should come&nbsp;and say it. Going to Hajj is one thing I decided when my mother died because I love my mum so much.</i></p><p><i>Islam is not what I just woke up to embrace even though my father was a Christian and my name is Elizabeth. Now to your question, there is nothing serious that has changed about me other than the fact that I am being careful with what I do. I respect myself and the fact that I am an Alhaja because people are watching and waiting to crucify me.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnmBkmxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
