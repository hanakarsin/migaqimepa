Until the recent record announcement, he had spent his entire life in the remote Nepalese mountain village of Rhimkholi, about 250 miles west of Kathmandu.</p><p>Commenting on the recognition, Dangi said: "I'm very happy that I'm being recognized by Guinness World Records and that my name will be written in a book.&nbsp; It's a big thing for my family, my village and my country.&nbsp; I am very happy."</p><p>Jyoti, from Nagpur, India, took the title of Shortest Living Woman when she reached the age of 18 in December last year.</p><p>She has a form of dwarfism called Achondroplasia and won't grow any taller than her current height.</p><p>Due to her size, she has to have clothes and jewellery specially made. She sleeps in a tiny bed and uses special plates and cutlery to eat.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Jyoti says she loves fashion and make-up and is currently pursuing her dream of becoming successful actress in the movie business.&nbsp; She has already starred in a number of Indian films.</p><p>"Since being recognised by Guinness World Records I have been able to visit lots of different countries. I love travelling. I have visited Japan and parts of Europe and now I can't wait to visit the UK," Jyoti said recently.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnqFj21loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
