Here's what you've been eating:</h2><p>Ireland's law states that bread's sugar-to-flour ratio shouldn't exceed two percent, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Subway's "heated sandwich" bread</a> apparently contains a whopping 10 percent ratio, according to The Independent.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the Irish Supreme Court is excluding Subway's bread from the "bread" category, because the sugar exceeds the limit by a shocking amount. Now, sandwiches, such as their mighty meatball subs, cannot be defined as a staple food, which goes untaxed.</p><p>According to Subway's U.S. Product Ingredient Guide, the chain offers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 different types of bread as of 2020</a>, and most of them include similar ingredients ‚Äî spices and herbs aside. The basics include wheat or white flour (aside from the gluten-free option), as well as water, yeast, sugar, some sort of oil, salt, and baking soda.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of them also include texture-centric ingredients, such as guar gum, ground rice, and toasted bread crumbs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>What will happen to Subway restaurants across the pond? They will most likely either be required to alter their bread recipe, but some speculate they could shut down or raise their prices, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">staple foods aren't taxed</a>, while "baked goods" are, per WBRC.&nbsp;</p><p>As of publication, the U.S. is seemingly still constituting Subway's bread as "bread," however, it's unclear if the U.S. has a different recipe, or if Ireland simply has higher standards for food. We're guessing it's the latter option, but it's yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much sugar is in a regular sandwich?</h2><p>Although Subway's sandwiches are apparently higher in sugar than most, there are some types of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">breads that are notoriously sugary</a>. According to Insider, if you're on a health kick, you should probably avoid consuming sandwich staples such as Martin's Potato Bread, most cinnamon-raisin varieties, and ‚Äî obviously ‚Äî that classic bag of white Wonder Bread. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USDA</a>, a standard slice of white bread should contain about 1.5 grams of sugar, a slice of toasted French bread should have about 2.1, and Focaccia should have about 1 gram. If you're looking for a to-go sammie that won't spike your sugar too much, we might suggest trying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy John's</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pret a Manger,</a> just to be safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, you could break out your chef's hat, and attempt <a href=#>a TikTok sandwich recipe</a>.
