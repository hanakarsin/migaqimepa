The veteran ABC anchor has experience dealing with politicians on debate stages since 2019 and on television sets for nearly two decades. It has some people wondering about her personal politics.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Linsey Davis’s politics are kept private.</h2><p>Like most respectable journalists, Linsey’s personal politics are private. Although she’s on ABC television almost every day as an anchor for ABC News Live Prime, weekend World News Tonight on Sundays, and files reports for World News Tonight, Good Morning America, 20/20, and Nightline, often covering both sides of the aisles, she doesn't share any political beliefs on air or on social media.</p><p>Linsey has 17 years of experience on air, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewing</a> the most important politicians of the last few decades, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Mike Pence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, senate candidate Herschel Walker, Senator Raphael Warnock, and nearly two dozen senators from both sides of the aisle and dozens of House representatives.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">In addition to working as an anchor, Linsey has written children’s books.</h2><p>Linsey has published six best-selling children’s books: Girls of the World published in February 2024, The Smallest Spot of a Dot published in January 2023, How High is Heaven published in February 2022, Stay This Way Forever published in February 2021, One Big Heart published in August 2019, and The World is Awake published in February 2019. Based on the titles and strong belief in Christianity, you might assume religion could be one factor that influences her politics.</p><p>Linsey started writing children’s books after giving birth to her son Ayden on March 28, 2014. While promoting her fourth book, How High is Heaven, in an interview on February 15, 2022, with People, Linsey explained why she decided to write for kids. She said, "Quite often, I'm doing the doom and gloom of the daily newscast. This is a lighter way to be joyful and be uplifting and tell the good news in a way that I hope that the kids and parents will appreciate."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">If you want to ask Linsey about her politics, sign up for a race.</h2><p>Linsey and her husband, <a href=#>Paul Roberts</a>, are avid runners. In a March 28, 2023, interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shape</a>, the journalist opened up about one of her current goals is to run a race in all 50 states. "My husband and I are hoping to round out our races in 50 states goal by ending in Hawaii as our final, 50th state in 2024."</p><p>Based on a recent Instagram post, she only has six more states to go!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Linsey Davis (@linseydavis)</a></p></figure><p>Whether Linsey is on your television screen interviewing newsmakers or training for a race in Montana, the next state on her 50 states journal, she won’t be revealing who she supports politically now or in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobavv8SyZJ2Zpp7AbrzOpaCtoZOo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
