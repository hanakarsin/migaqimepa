They remember any contestant we've seen before and they could tell you the winners of any given season. So when judge Heidi Klum was absent from her judging chair for two episodes of Season 15, fans wanted to know what was up. Rumors started to circulate because it's unlike her to miss anything and, because of the timing, people wondered: did Heidi Klum have COVID-19?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Heidi Klum on June 16 episode of 'AGT'?</h2><p>Viewers tuned in to the show on June 16 and the first half of the show was all business as usual with the judges doing their thing and the contestants being a hit or miss.&nbsp;</p><p>However, things changed halfway through the show when instead of Heidi being in the judge's seat sitting next to Howie Mandel, Eric Stonestreet was between Howie and Modern Family co-star and new AGT judge, Sofia Vergara. It's really hard to mistake Eric for Heidi and fans took note of her absence.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait Heidi seriously didn‚Äôt show up for the second half?

Since the filming was happening in early March ‚Äì before any stay-at-home orders were in place ‚Äî Heidi and the crew were concerned her symptoms may have been due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>"When I fell ill, it was on March 10. I was experiencing fever and sore throat, so I told production and immediately the medic did my vitals and said, 'Yes, you have a fever,' and then I was dismissed," Heidi said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anyone else just watch <a href=#>@AGT</a> and see <a href=#>@howiemandel</a> talking to <a href=#>@heidiklum</a> on FaceTime?

"I told them how I was feeling. They looked at me, checked me out and said, 'Yeah, go home.' Then I was asked to get tested ASAP so that I could go back to work because we didn't know that this was all unfolding the way it did. They were like, 'Okay, get tested as fast as you can.' "&nbsp;</p><p>At that time, it wasn't simple to get ahold of a test for the novel coronavirus and Heidi said she had trouble getting tested. "I tried and I went on the search for the test. I was unaware that there were no tests anywhere. I was just asking everyone because we were told that there are tests for everyone," she said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Day 14 of staying H‚ù§Ô∏èME #covid_19negative</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Heidi Klum</a> (@heidiklum) on Mar 24, 2020 at 4:37pm PDT</p></figure><p>It was later revealed that Heidi did not have coronavirus, but it was the right thing to do to step away from the large audience, crew, and contestants when she had symptoms that could have been COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Heidi Klum return to 'AGT' Season 15?</h2><p>"I only got to tape for five days before I fell ill.
