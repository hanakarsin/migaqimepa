Thankfully, he's now gone into remission.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Bublé (@michaelbuble)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @michaelbuble</span></figure><p>Michael excitedly spoke about Noah’s future career aspirations on his YouTube channel, saying, “You know what he wants to be when he grows up? Not an actor, not a singer. He wants to swim with sharks. So this is our superhero. We have two other superheroes, but this boy … he is the biggest inspiration for us."</p><p>For Michael, quality time with his kids is super important.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Bublé (@michaelbuble)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @michaelbuble</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s what you should know about Michael Bublé‘s wife, Luisana Lopilato.</h2><p>Michael married his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luisana Lopilato</a>, in 2011, and they’ve been going strong ever since. Luisana is most likely super comfortable with Michael’s fame since she has some experience of her own working as an actress, model, and singer.</p><p>Between 2002 and 2004, she was even a member of a pop-rock band called Erreway. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>, Michael faced a bit of anxiety before making things official with Luisana.</p><p>He revealed, “I was so nervous before I asked my wife to marry me — it was the scariest decision of my life. I did it in front of her family, who are Argentinian, and I learned Spanish especially [for the proposal.] That was the scariest part — being in front of them and asking her father's permission beforehand."</p><p>He explained that he wasn’t sure if she was the one but he hoped she would be because he liked her so much and considered her to be a great person.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Michael Bublé (@michaelbuble)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram @michaelbuble</span></figure><p>Michael described her as a beautiful, compassionate, smart, humble, talented, and empathetic woman with admirable qualities. What a lot of people might not know is that there’s actually a 12-year age gap between the couple, and she's older than he is. In Michael's opinion, their age difference doesn’t make a difference at all — aside from the fact that she’s a total boss in his eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2aapZe5pnnKopus</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
