Naija News understands that it took minutes before the player was resuscitated after the incident.</p><p>Subsequently, after a statement claimed the Erikson is in stable condition but still in the hospital, the player in a short statement released to the Italian newspaper Gazzetta Dello Sport via his agent, thanked fans for their support and concern and vowed to find out why he suffered a serious health emergency.</p><p>The statement reads: “Thank you, I won’t give up. I feel better now – but I want to understand what’s happened.</p><p>‘I want to say thank you all for what you did for me. Now he just has to rest, with him are his wife and parents,’ Eriksen’s agent added.</p><p>‘He will remain under observation. But in any case, he wants to cheer on his teammates against Belgium.’</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that Eriksen’s teammates, Hojbjerg, Braithwaite, and Leicester City goalkeeper Schmeichel have all expressed their feelings about the scary event that happened on Saturday.</p><p>Schmeichel said: ‘I have chosen to say to myself that this has had a happy ending – it’s not the end yet, but it could have been so much worse.</p><p>‘I am grateful to be part of a team that has stood together as much as we have done. And I’m grateful Christian’s still here. I tried to imagine if it was me who was lying there. I knew Christian’s wife, children, and parents were there, so at one point I tried to look for them. It is an inhuman situation for them to go through.’</p><p>On his part, FC Barcelona player, Braithwaite said: ‘We were all about to lose a friend and a teammate. I do not remember exactly what I said in the prayer. But it has strengthened my faith, that’s for sure.’</p><p>Hojbjerg said: ‘I saw Christian lying there and looking towards the field. His eyes were white and I thought it looked very strange. I saw Simon Kjaer rush off, and then you start thinking what it is. I walked slowly across the bench.</p><p>‘More and more first aiders came over, and I could see Simon waving his arms. I stood for a long time with the coaches and talked, and I could see that there are some arms that move with the first aid. That was creepy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5BtZpygop7AtbXAp2SeqpmgwKa6jKaYpJ2jYrOqvtKtZKmtkqG2pHnSrZitnZ2au7V5wJ%2BrnqpdmLytuMCpqp5ln6N6sbXTnJ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
