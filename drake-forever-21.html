The rap prodigy kept to his promise, but it seems some fans might have preferred if he didn't.</p><p>The 14-track album featured less of Drake's routine rhymes and more of his vocals paired with upbeat instrumentals. On Twitter, fans seemed to agree that "Honestly, Nevermind" was giving off much more of a mainstream pop sound than his past albums.</p><p>"Why Drake [does] sound like he's singing in the shower on every track? I'm heated," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> one user. Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, "I laughed when Drake started singing on the second track so let me go to bed and try again in the morning.</p><p>The feedback got even worse. Fans started bringing fashion into the mix, and Drizzy's latest album did not pass the drip test. In fact, it was being compared to the likes of fast-fashion retailer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forever 21</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all the petty, hilarious slander. Plus, for those not in the know, we'll break down why Drake's album being compared to Forever 21 is actually kind of a major burn.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Drake's fans couldn't stop comparing 'Honestly, Nevermind' to Forever 21.</h2><p>After the album was released, some of the first reactions to it on Twitter classified it as "a mall music album." And from there, the comments started getting even more specific.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake really dropped a mall music album</p>— Özhi | オザン (@DuoMensis) <a href=#>June 17, 2022</a></figure><p>Fans started naming stores that the album reminded them of. "I thought Drake was finna rap his a-- off. He gave us Forever 21, Hot Topic, H&M a-- music," one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p>It seemed that the store references really caught on and in particular, people really leaned in to the Forever 21 bit.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drake got me feeling like I’m walking through Forever 21</p>— ✍🏾 (@unclelondonn__) <a href=#>June 17, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>drake dropped an album full of forever 21 music, let’s move on and act like it didn’t happen</p>— 𝑴𝒂𝒕𝒕¹³🎡 (@RocketzPlsWin) <a href=#>June 17, 2022</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Man — Drake came out with an exclusive album for <a href=#>@Forever21</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t5a8BOxAZ8</a></p>— David Gokhshtein (@davidgokhshtein) <a href=#>June 17, 2022</a></figure><p>In case you're wondering, being compared to Forever 21 is a major diss. Forever 21, a prominent fast-fashion retailer headquartered in L.A., was (and still kind of is) a very popular chain store amongst young people. The brand is known for offering fashionable and trendy pieces at very low prices. However, it's gained somewhat of a negative image over the years as it's gotten itself involved in a number of controversies.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me in forever 21 listening to new drake album <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RDMHD8Th2Q</a></p>— honestly, nevermind (@gotwildt) <a href=#>June 17, 2022</a></figure><p>Major issues with the brand include its labor practices as well claims of copyright infringement. In fact, Forever 21 was sued by <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> after it dressed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its models in clothing that looked like it was copied from her "7 Rings" music video</a>.</p><p>It has also been criticized for some of its slogans printed on clothing, such as its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Allergic to Algebra" shirt</a> in 2011. Not to mention, Forever 21 was called out by consumers after it used <a href=#>a white model to advertise its "Blank Panther" sweater</a>.</p><p>All this piled up and lead <a href=#>Forever 21 to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in September 2019. The company shut down a handful of its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">international locations and 178 of its stores</a> in the U.S.</p><p>While the store still exists today in a limited capacity, it doesn't have the most positive image. These days, many shoppers are opting for higher-quality, more <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sustainable attire</a>.</p><p>However, Forever 21 hasn't lost its entire fanbase and neither has Drake. Some fans liked hearing this different side of the Toronto native.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Unpopular opinion: I like singing Drake 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>— Ernie. (@Negraaababyyy) <a href=#>June 17, 2022</a></figure><p>Bottom line: It's just all about what you prefer. And even if he did take an L with this album, I'm sure Drake, who was crowned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard's Artist of the Decade</a> in 2021, will be just fine. It will just make his next studio album even better, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb%2Bit8Rmnaiqlauys3mRag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
