For the last few years, KRA pin holders have been flocking various cyber cafes trying to beat the deadline for filing tax returns. Thanks to the KRA iTax system, it is now possible and easy to file nil returns at the comfort of your home. Here is a guide on how to file KRA returns if not employed or you are a student.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/20f6e7cbef4d60f1.jpeg><p class=align-left>Filing returns in the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) website is mandatory for every Kenyan who holds a verified KRA PIN. The government, through KRA, has come up with an online system known as the iTax used by taxpayers to file their returns online. Filing of tax returns applies to the employed, unemployed as well as students who hold the KRA PIN. The taxman also requires the unemployed and the student returns. They, therefore, need to file nil returns since they have no income at all or their income is merely below the taxable amount, which is Kshs.12.000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/31c611f615e559d6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to file your tax returns through the KRA iTax portal</span></p></a><p class=align-left>How to file KRA returns if not employed may seem like a hectic and time-consuming process, but with the right information, it is an effortless task. Individuals who file nil returns save themselves from the stress of paying the penalty which currently amounts to Kshs.20,000 annually. This penalty falls on those who fail to file their returns. This KRA penalty for not filing returns may hinder you from getting your dream job. This is because most companies nowadays ask for a tax compliance certificate from KRA before giving you a job. With pending penalties, you cannot get this certificate from the taxman.</p><h2>Do you have to file tax returns if you have no income?</h2><p class=align-left>The above is a question that many individuals ask, and the answer is definitely, yes. You will be required to file nil returns in the KRA portal to avoid hefty penalty charges. No need to pay substantial penalties when the whole filling process takes a few minutes. File your returns to be on the safe side.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/40c4ba4810ded249.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>YouTube to start deducting taxes from creators outside the US</span></p></a><h2>How to file KRA nil returns for students and unemployed</h2><p class=align-left>Below are some simple to follow guidelines on how students should file KRA income tax returns.
