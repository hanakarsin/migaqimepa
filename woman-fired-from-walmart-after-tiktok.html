A <a href=#>Domino's delivery driver</a> posts constantly about the tips she receives (or doesn't receive) on her various shifts. An Instacart shopper recently put a customer <a href=#>on blast</a> for trying to illicit a refund under false pretenses for a ridiculously large order. However, this kind of behavior runs the risk of being seen by higher-ups who may feel compelled to take action.</p><p>In recent news, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walmart employee was fired from her job</a> after reportedly working there for over 16 years. According to the former Walmart coach, she was fired over content posted to TikTok exposing some <a href=#>harsher aspects of working retail</a> at the big-chain store. Keep reading for more details on this former Walmart worker and the exposÃ© TikTok that supposedly got her fired.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@stephunleashed</a><p>@stephunleashed burns her old Walmart apparel on TikTok</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman was fired from Walmart after 16 years because of her TikTok posts.</h2><p>The former Walmart employee, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@stephunleashed</a> on TikTok, previously held the position of a store coach. According to Walmart's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">career website</a>, a coach "supports their team by making sure their goals align to the goals of the business. They communicate with leads about their team's performance and plans on how to improve the business performance."</p><p>Apparently, a coach's role to "communicate" doesn't necessarily involve sharing the store's more frustrating duties on TikTok.</p><p>Steph originally broke the news about her termination in a TikTok <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> on Jan. 9, 2023. In it, she proudly tears apart one of her many blue Walmart employee T-shirts as she celebrates her subsequent freedom from the job.</p><p>In a follow-up post posted on Jan. 10, she shared "one of" the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">videos</a> that reportedly got her fired. In this video, she chronicles "the worst inventory [she's] ever done" as she and her former employees painstakingly scan every product in the store.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@stephunleashed href=#>@stephunleashed</a><p>You guys keep asking what video got me fired?

"Showing off their 1990s scanners and explaining how inventory goes in every store in America? Wow."</p><p>Other users posited that it may not have been the content itself, but the fact that she was on her phone during work hours that got her canned.</p><p>One person commented, "Not condoning you getting fired, but Walmart probably has a social media policy that you may have breached by recording while on shift, [especially at the] back store."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@stephunleashed href=#>@stephunleashed</a><p>I bet he enjoyed every single one of emðŸ˜…ðŸ¤­ <a title=fired href=#>#fired</a> <a title=firedfromwalmart href=#>#firedfromwalmart</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=DoritosTriangleTryout href=#>#DoritosTriangleTryout</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=crazy href=#>#crazy</a> <a title=walmart href=#>#walmart</a> <a title=retail href=#>#retail</a> <a title=unemployed href=#>#unemployed</a> <a title=winning href=#>#winning</a></p><a title="â™¬ Mfkn Star - girls" href=#>â™¬ Mfkn Star - girls</a></figure><p>Another person claims, "I was a manager at Walmart and I would have to stay on the teenagers about seeing their phones out.

Many of her recent TikToks show her openly expressing the disdain she had for the job.
