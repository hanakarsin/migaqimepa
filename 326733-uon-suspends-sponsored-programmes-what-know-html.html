That headlines were screaming "UoN suspends self-sponsored programmes." Such a development had been cooking for a long time with the Education Cabinet Secretary (CS) hinting earlier that reforms in this sector were imminent and inevitable. While the university was doing away with the body in charge of self-sponsored programmes, the actual services offered by the programme will not be affected as they will be taken over by the mainstream organs of the institution.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/c414e08ab9f9633f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Higher education has come under intense scrutiny in recent times owing to such things as dwindling enrollment rates, unmanageable levels of debts and wanting performances. The growth of universities and other institutions of higher learning has aided the country in respect to developing a professional and innovative workforce. Still, nobody saw the reality that it was a double-edged sword capable of cutting deep into the country’s spine.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/44deb076d049702a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Johnson Sakaja: Demolitions Will Be a Thing of The Past Under My Leadership as Governor</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The country has been forced to dig deep into taxpayers’ money to bail out hailing universities that have failed to manage their debts. Such challenges have not spared even the most advanced institutions, such as the University of Nairobi.</p><h2>UoN suspends self-sponsored programmes</h2><p class=align-left>Here is everything you need to know about the suspension:</p><h3>Resolve by the university council</h3><p class=align-left>The directive to shut down UoN self-sponsored programmes did not just come from anybody but the University of Nairobi council itself. The news was disseminated by Julia Ojiambo, who is the chairperson of the Council. According to her, the decision was arrived at following a meeting on the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">19th of November, 2019</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Upon discussing the establishment and functions of the Center for Self-Sponsored Programmes (CESSP), it was agreed that the body should be suspended. A statute that had enabled the establishment of the self-sponsored programme was scrapped with immediate effect. The Council chair was quick to assure interested parties that this move would not affect the operations of the university in any way.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/457122c0b5cdb107.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ruto's People-Centric Campaign Model Has Forced Power-Thirsty Raila Back to Drawing Board</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/44deb076d049702a.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>List of top colleges in Nairobi</p><h3>Reason for UoN CESSP suspension</h3><p class=align-left>The University of Nairobi is one of three public universities that were declared technically insolvent earlier this year. The school has been operating on bank overdrafts and has subsequently failed to remit billions in employees’ statutory deductions. It was an attempt by the school to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cut on costs </a>as directed by the president.</p><p class=align-left>Other cost-cutting measures that will come into effect include the stopping of office tea and snacks and the halting of capital projects in the current financial year. CESSP UoN application rates have also dwindled drastically in recent years. It is because the grades for government-sponsored courses were reduced, thus meaning that many students are already enrolled in universities.</p><p class=align-left>Those who do not get the chance to be enrolled under government-sponsored programs are admitted into technical institutions and other colleges. As a result, the number of students entering the University of Nairobi under the CESSP program has made it difficult to be economically viable for the institution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/07622d22763d919f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Museveni Advises Ugandans to Start Eating Cassava if They Can No Longer Afford Bread</span></p></a><h3>CESSP staff absorbed into other departments</h3><p class=align-left>The suspension of self-sponsored programmes would have spelled doom for university staff who had been working under that programme. The school will see to it that they are assigned other roles to avoid the disorientation of those staff members.</p><p class=align-left>If not well managed, this would have played out into the labour courts and unions, but the school seems to have all under control at the moment. The Council chair reiterated that CESSP staff would not only be redeployed into the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> mainstream services </a>of the institution, but they would also be assigned duties that match their training.</p><h3>The money question</h3><p class=align-left>There has always been a notion that Kenyan universities have self-sponsored programmes for the sole purpose of making money to run the institutions. With the suspension of the self-sponsored program at the UoN, what will happen to the funds raised from self-sponsored students at University of Nairobi?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e6bb6cc56a88dd3d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>High Court Declares Huduma Namba Useless in Landmark Ruling</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The school council chair made it clear that the banking facilities that had been designated to the CESSP programme will not stop functioning as recognized signatories were still authorized to operate them. This is because even though the body had been suspended, the school functions and services will continue to be discharged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/457122c0b5cdb107.jpeg><h3>Will UoN stop admission for self-sponsored students?</h3><p class=align-left>The school suspended parallel management of self-sponsored programmes but did not suspend the programmes themselves. The only thing that has changed is that activities previously under the programme will now be redirected to other organs of the school.</p><p class=align-left>The suspension aimed to cut costs in compliance with a directive by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Since the school’s council chair said that the university will continue to discharge services seamlessly, current and prospective students have nothing to worry about until it is otherwise communicated.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Best accounting courses that are marketable now</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/f4b21416f214af26.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Only Military Can Effectively Manage Kenya Power, Lawyer Donald Kipkorir</span></p></a><h3>Yes, the media got it wrong</h3><p class=align-left>The media plays a vital role in informing people about current events as they occur. When the University of Nairobi Council Chair communicated that the university was suspending its parallel programmes, various media outlets were quick to inform their leaders that the university will no longer admit self-sponsored students.</p><p class=align-left>It was a misinterpretation of the message, which in real sense means that the university was only scrapping off a statute that had facilitated the establishment of the CESSP programme and placing its services under the other organs of the institution that have been dealing with government-sponsored students. This erroneous reporting in the media prompted the university to clear the air that it was not doing away with self-sponsored students.</p><p class=align-left>University of Nairobi has long been among the most preferred institutions of higher learning by both government and self-sponsored students. When news emerged that UoN suspends self-sponsored programmes, many were quick to interpret that it was the end of parallel programs at the institution. While it was the end of the CESSP programme, it is only the body that was suspended, but all the other university services will continue without any disruption.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/00fb5635ba9aa2b2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan John Gatambia Irungu Elected Student’s President in The University of The District of Columbia</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Marketable technical courses in Kenya</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2FkW9ubGtdqryvedKuqqmdnpnAbr%2FPqKWsp6KasW680aieq5mdorK0edahmK1lm6O8uHrHraSl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
