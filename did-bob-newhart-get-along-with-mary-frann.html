Did Bob and Mary get along?</h2><p>In a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, Bob recounted how he warned Mary when she landed the role of Joanna Loudon, Bob's on-screen wife in Newhart, that she had some big shoes to fill.</p><p>“Suzie and I had a great relationship. Those things are hard to find," he told the outlet. "Later, when I was doing ‘Newhart,’ I told [on-screen wife] Mary Frann, ‘You have a really tough job because they’re going to think of my wife as Suzie.'"</p><p>In a 1983 interview with The Cincinnati Enquirer, Mary admitted that she was even a fan of Bob's work before auditioning for her role on Newhart.</p><p>"I always liked the old Bob Newhart Show and liked him tremendously," she told the outlet, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Catchy Comedy</a>. "Had I realized that, gee, this is really incredible, it might have frozen me up. But I was very relaxed, and when I read for the producers and directors, I had a terrific time."</p><p>It seems that the pair had good chemistry on-screen, even if it wasn't to the degree that Bob had with Suzanne — but there was nothing to indicate that the pair didn't get along. That said, neither has publicly commented on their on-screen relationship in the years since the show concluded.</p><p>Mary passed away in September 1998, while <a href=#>Bob passed away</a> in July 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecGomWamlay1or7TZp6erF2WubC6xmauoqyYYrqivthmnauZnqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
