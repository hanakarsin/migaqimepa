Fortunately for the Nigerian-born British boxer, he knocked out the Finn boxer in the 7th round barely a week ago. Hence, the talk over the Wilder-Joshua fight has gained more prominence.</p><p>In an interview with Sky Sports, Wilder’s manager Shelly Finkel said, “I am optimistic that a deal can be made for Deontay to fight Joshua in early 2024.”</p><p>Anthony Joshua’s knockout victory over Robert Helenius was “needed,” according to Deontay Wilder’s head trainer, Malik Scott, in the lead-up to their potential January super fight in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Scott stated that he and Wilder were pleased with AJ’s victory because it raises the stakes for their potential bout in January, even though Wilder’s camp is almost certain of victory.</p><p>“He (Wilder) wavelike ‘we needed that’. We both said the same thing because at first, it was looking like it was getting ready to go the distance,” Scott told the October Red YouTube channel.</p><p>“So when the knockout came I called him on FaceTime and he was like, I’m glad he got that, we needed it done just like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BwZq2ZnKDAbrvVnqlmop%2BotbatjK%2BqZq%2BZobGmvoyipa2dnqi2p8WMmp2tnaJirqu%2FjK%2BgnKyfp8Zuu9WeqWaglaGyr7XUrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
