Marjorie Taylor Greene because she used his music without permission.</h2><p>It appears as though Dr. Dre is taking a firm stance against Greene using his music in her political campaigning. According to a letter obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, the rapper and his legal team are pursuing action against the politician because she used the "Still D.R.E." instrumental in a promotional video shared to social media on Jan. 9, 2023.</p><p>In their letter, Dr. Dre and his team accused Greene of "wrongfully exploiting this work through the various social media outlets to promote your divisive and hateful political agenda."</p><p>The letter further noted that the award-winning rapper "has not, and will never, grant you permission to broadcast or disseminate any of his music."</p><p>"One might expect that, as a member of Congress, you would have a passing familiarity with the laws of our country," the letter goes on to read. "It’s possible, though, that laws governing intellectual property are a little too arcane and insufficiently populist for you to really have spent much time on. We’re writing because we think an actual lawmaker should be making laws not breaking laws, especially those embodied in the constitution by the founding fathers."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In conclusion, the politician was instructed to "cease and desist from any further unauthorized use of" Dr. Dre's music and provide "written confirmation that you have complied with these demands before Jan. 11, 2023, by 5 p.m. EST."</p><p>As of the time of writing, the tweet that featured the song's instrumental has been removed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Marjorie Taylor Greene clapped back at Dr. Dre's copyright infringement claims.</h2><p>In a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Greene hit back at Dr. Dre after being instructed to remove his music from her social media pages.</p><p>"While I appreciate the creative chord progression, I would never play your words of violence against women and police officers, and your glorification of the thug life and drugs," she said of the rapper's work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zts6roJ5lpJbGrbvRZp6rnZWjsm6w0Wabq51dl7Kmsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
