Here's how to get it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure><p>If you've played <a href=#>Breath of the Wild</a>, you may have quite a collection of photographs saved on the Sheikah Slate of Hyrule's grandest sights or the hero Link posing with his weapons at the ready.</p><p>The camera on the powerful device was a niche addition for players to mess around with, allowing them to capture moments of their journey with a click of a button or build out their compendium of weapons, monsters, and other features of the new Hyrule map.</p><p>Franchises like <a href=#>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, <a href=#>Horizon Forbidden West</a>, and more have helped push for photo modes in AAA video games. And as expected, <a href=#>Tears of the Kingdom</a> follows suit, offering a similar camera feature that debuted in its prequel. The only thing is players must first unlock the camera feature 6 to use it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to get the camera in 'Tears of the Kingdom.'</h2><p>After leaving the sky islands at the beginning of the game and landing in Hyrule, you must meet <a href=#>Purah</a> to begin unlocking the camera feature. This meeting kickstarts the Regional Phenomena main quest, urging you to visit one of the four major races to resolve whatever's plaguing that region.</p><p>Head to Robbie and Josha near Lookout Landing after to trigger a conversation about the camera.</p><p>From here, you must venture inside the Hyrule Field Chasm to glean more information about the camera component. Just south of Lookout Landing on the map will be a red spot that indicates where to find the chasm.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span><p>The Hyrule Field Chasm location on the map.</p></figure><p>Once inside, you will find an NPC pointing you toward Robbie's location, sending you across <a href=#>the Depths</a>. We recommend using Brightbloom Seeds to light up your path toward Robbie and activating Lightroots on the way to permanently illuminate patches of the map.</p><p>Robbie will be west of the Iayusus Lightroot, where he'll explain how to utilize the camera to take a picture of Josha.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to use the camera in 'Tears of the Kingdom.'</h2><p>Once you've unlocked the camera feature, you can freely access it by opening the L button menu. It'll be next to Ascend and Ultrahand on the ability wheel.</p><p>You can select it to take pictures of environments in front of you or do self-portrait shots by pressing X. All photographs will get added to your compendium for later viewing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nintendo</span></figure><p>The camera in Tears of the Kingdom isn't a super robust system where you can pause the action for climatic shots or is filter-heavy like in other titles, but it does scratch the itch for saving a memory or two when on the go.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available exclusively on Nintendo Switch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGLBqbGMnJimnaKWerWxwKuqZqeWYsGpsYykoKeflKS6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
