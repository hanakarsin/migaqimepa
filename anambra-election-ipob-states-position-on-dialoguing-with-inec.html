We have nothing to do with the election INEC is conducting and we wonder why INEC would want to drag us into the election.</p><p>“INEC should face what is facing it and leave IPOB alone. We did not dialogue with Nigerian government let alone INEC, an agency of the clueless government of Nigeria. It is an insult coming from a body known for fraudulently imposing and installing electoral criminals on the people.</p><p>“We found laughable the declaration by the Nigeria Police that they are coming to Anambra State governorship election on the 6th of November with 33,000 personnel and eight helicopters to kill Igbo citizens on that day.</p><p>“This statement from the Police IGP, shows how prepared they are to kill our people and also a clear indication that Nigeria Police and the cabal do not want the election in Anambra State to hold.</p><p>“We also want to place on record that the plan by the Nigeria Police to deploy over 33,000 policemen and three helicopters, among others to Anambra State for the November 6 governorship election is another ploy to kill more innocent Biafrans.”</p><p>IPOB stated that the deployment of more security operatives to the state was a ploy to kill more Igbo youths.</p><p>The group advised southeasterners in Anambra State to be very cautious of what they described as a wicked plot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BxZpqmkaKvs62MnqOem6SevK95yKmmm2Wjqa61sdJmp6irmam2sLqMqKVmnJmWubCz1KKloGWnnsGpecinnJxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
