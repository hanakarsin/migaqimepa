Otoh’s demise was, however, made public hours after the tragic incident.</p><p>The church said details of his funeral would be made public once the details are finalised. <strong>Naija News</strong> understands that Pastor&nbsp;Otoh was also a medical consultant.</p><p>“It is with rude shock and great sadness, but with consolation in His word, we at THE SHEPHERD’S HOUSE ASSEMBLY announce the passing on to Glory of our beloved pastor, husband, father, medical consultant Rev. Dr Daniel Otoh.”</p><p>“He transitioned on Sunday, 4th December 2022.</p><p>“He was a great treasure and inspiration to us all here at the Shepherd’s House church.</p><p>“In conjunction with the family, visitation and funeral announcements will be made available as soon as those details are finalised.</p><p>“We do not mourn. To sleep in Christ is a gain to heaven. Let God be God,” the Church’s statement reads.</p><p>Meanwhile, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, on Wednesday urged all his ministers to take the ‘issue of Nigeria seriously’.</p><p>Speaking at the Redemption City, the clergyman, while addressing ministers of the mission, lamented the situation in the country.</p><p>He pleaded with his audience to come out of their current shell and actively participate in the processes leading to the desired change.</p><p>He reminded them that the Bible described them as the salt and light of the earth, hence they ought to act accordingly.</p><p>In his words: “The Bible says the wise rules over the foolish, are we foolish? Are you sure, the only One who can help us now is God. We are to cry to Him to help us. The Bible tells us the story of a widow who was heavily indebted, all along she sat down at home doing nothing and the Almighty God was there in heaven looking at her. Her husband died in debt, her children about to be taken away then she cried to the man of God for help.</p><p>“Likewise, we all sat down at home doing nothing expecting the Almighty God to come and do what we suppose to do by ourselves. If all the ministers in The Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG would take the issue of Nigeria seriously and God helping us , things would be better.”</p><p>Adeboye once again reiterated that he had not received a message from God to confirm if there will be an election next year. He stated that when he gets desperate and ask the lord for an answer what he gets in return is ”If He tell you are you going to do anything about it?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49xZqmnoKq5or6Mp6CgnaKerq95z5qqraeiYrGqsdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
