She previously appeared on The Jamie Foxx Show, and most recently in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Additionally, the 53-year-old co-hosted the Fox entertainment show Hollywood Today Live in 2016.</p><p>So, should RHOBH fans be concerned about what this could mean for the reality star's position in the future of the Bravo franchise? At this time, the actress has not confirmed if she will be returning for Season 11 of the reality series.&nbsp;</p><p>One cast member who is definitely not coming back, though, is <a href=#>Denise Richards</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Denise Richards will not be returning for Season 11 of 'RHOBH.'</h2><p>In September, a rep for the actress confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a> that she would be exiting the show after Season 10. Though a reason was not stated for her departure from the show, Denise has been plagued by cheating rumors throughout the season after reports surfaced that she had cheated on her husband with fellow co-star Brandi Glanville.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the casting news, Garcelle (who always supported Denise) shared a cryptic Instagram post, writing, "#plottwist Things just got interesting…” The two women had a pact that they would only return for the following season if the other agreed. So, will Garcelle honor that arrangement?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>Though the Bravo star has kept mum on her housewives status, she did open up about Denise's departure from the show on SiriusXM’s The Jenny McCarthy Show on Sep. 10. “I’m not surprised with the way things went,” she told the host. “This was a really hard season for her and I think when you’re being constantly talked about, it could affect your marriage, it could affect your kids. I think that’s where she was coming from. I think she’s just had enough.”&nbsp;</p><p>Executive producer Andy Cohen also opened up about Denise's departure on People's Reality Check: “I’m just upset that we couldn’t reach an agreement for next season, I’m kind of living in that sadness." He added, "We were negotiating a deal with her and we couldn’t reach an agreement on the deal. ... Whatever happened or didn’t happen, I would imagine that it’s something she didn’t really care to discuss on a television show.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBus8Crmp6knJp6rbHAr6Cnn12ntbCuxw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
