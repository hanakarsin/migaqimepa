You come to an event to decorate with a group of 10 people, and you eat a lot of food and drink like you were invited. You were paid to decorate, not decorate, eat, and drink even though some of the invited guests miss food because of you. Makeup artistes also, after their work, they stay and eat," he wrote in part.<p class=align-left>He added:</p>"The person brings the cake then stays and eat the food. I am not trying to be mean, but you were not budgeted for, those caterers bring food for only the plates paid for. The only service provider to eat the food is the Emcee."<p class=align-left>His sentiments ignited mixed relations among his followers and below are their comments:</p><p class=align-left><strong>Ritah Martha Elvis wrote:</strong></p>"You have forgotten the photographers."<p class=align-left><strong>Travis Sean Gosipboy:</strong></p>"Please state that when you're booking us, that you won't provide food or transport so that we can add the money on the charges and see if you won't pay it.

I once attended a wedding where an artiste was performing, and his whole crew ate first, and many guests missed food."<p class=align-left><strong>Sylvia Namusoke Amooti said:</strong></p>"So decorators come the night before, and they are not supposed to eat? An Mc comes at midday, and he’s supposed to eat? Is it because you are an Mc? As a decorator, I usually ask the clients if they will cater for our meals. If they can’t, then we sort ourselves."<p class=align-left><strong>Moustey Mustapha wrote:</strong></p>"If you don't budget for the sound crew and Dj, I don't accept to work with you.
