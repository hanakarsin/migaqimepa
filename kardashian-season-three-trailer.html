As <a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a> says, "I wish I could tell you that this is going to be a mild, relaxing, serene season. It's not."</p><p>The ladies have all had their fair share of drama splashed all over the tabloids, from breakups to health scares to the Kanye of it all.</p><p>Find out more on what to expect from <a href=#>The Kardashians </a>Season 3 below.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kim might finally share her side of the story when it comes to current relationship with Kanye.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>The trailer opens with Kim saying, "Listen, everyone has their own truth of how they think something happened."</p><p>We see glimpses of her Dolce & Gabbana collab interspersed with clips of her stressed out and venting to her sisters. About what exactly? Well, if you've been living under a rock, Kim's ex-husband, multi-hyphenate rapper <a href=#>Kanye West, </a>was canceled for his anti-semitic remarks and erratic behavior.</p><p>As a result, he lost multiple brand deals and partnerships including his billion-dollar <a href=#>Yeezy partnership with Adidas, </a>tanking his net worth. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone exposé</a>, it was also revealed that Kanye would also share sex tapes of Kim during business meetings with Yeezy staff and partners.</p><p>Amid his downward spiral, Kim has been dealing with a lot.
