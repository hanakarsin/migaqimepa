Sometimes they would say I didn’t have the experience so they would pick whoever was their favourite.</p><p>“It was a lot of pressure on a young athlete. I considered quitting. I really wanted to travel with the senior national team and some coaches told me to try the hurdles.”</p><p>Tobi also stated that she had to overcome doubts and challenges to attain her achievements adding that she had never thought of going to the United States.</p><p>She said: “The typical Nigerian approach is to make you feel like you cannot make it. I wasn’t expecting to medal at those Games. There were so many voices saying I couldn’t but I used that to show that I could and that title changed my life.</p><p>“That’s how I got a scholarship to the United States. I can say that’s really when my athletics career began. I never dreamt of going to the United States. I just wanted to run fast and be one of the Nigerian greats.</p><p>“2019 was tough because I remember running the fastest time in the qualification rounds, around the same time in the semi-finals and the same time in the final.</p><p>“I ran so fast but wasn’t fast enough to get a medal. I was broken, I was devastated. That was one of the most horrible experiences.</p><p>“I moved on, and then came the Tokyo Olympics. Things just crumbled a month before when I strained my hamstring at practice.”</p><h2>Tobi Amusan Athletics’ World Record</h2><p>The 25-year-old track and field athlete made her country proud after becoming the first Nigerian to win a World Athletics Championship gold medal in the women’s 100m hurdles in Eugene, Oregon.</p><p>Amusan defeated Jamaica’s Britany Anderson, who ended with Silver in 12.23 seconds and Olympic champion Jasmine Camacho-Quinn of Puerto Rico, who settled for bronze in 12.23 seconds.</p><p>She had smashed the world record in the semi-final where she clocked 12.12 seconds and powered over the line at Hayward Field in an incredible 12.06 seconds.</p><p>According to reports said her winning time, however, will not be recognised as a world record due to a strong following wind of 2.5 metres per second.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FwZqehl5q%2Fqq3SZp6opJSau26zyKujZqyfl7ZurcyuqpqmXai9pq3KrGSopl2dvLh50qGcZpmcory0wIyqrKKsXZbBqbjEraCcq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
