Instead, the youngest Roloff sibling has enjoyed a much more private life. What viewers (who don't follow the Roloffs via social media) might not know is that today, Jacob is a married man and a father.</p><p>So who is <a href=#>Isabel Roloff</a>? Keep reading to learn more about Jacob's wife and their baby.</p><p>Like his siblings before him, Jacob held his wedding at Roloff Farms. Unlike Zach, Jeremy, and Molly, however, the youngest Roloff opted to not have his nuptials televised on Little People, Big World. Jacob and Isabel Rock tied the knot in September 2019 during a rustic, farmhouse ceremony, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@isabelsofiarock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Isabel Roloff?</h2><p>Like her husband Jacob, Isabel Roloff is a creative type. She's a talented photographer, as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couple's website clearly displays</a>, as well as a writer, musician, and singer.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Isabel Sofia (@isabelsofiarock)</a></p></figure><p>Through the years, she has sold photography (sometimes by Jacob) paired with her original poetry.

They've since left the van life behind for a permanent home and a family. But they definitely had some amazing adventures while it lasted.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What does Isabel Roloff do for a living?</h2><p>It's unclear whether Isabel holds a part-time or full-time job, or to what capacity her passions bring in money today. Eagle-eyed fans did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spot her helping out on Roloff Farms</a> during pumpkin season in 2021. But these days, it seems Isabel is mostly focused on motherhood.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@rolofffarms</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jacob and Isabel Roloff welcomed a baby boy in December 2021.</h2><p>On Dec. 4, 2021, Jacob and Isabel welcomed a baby boy they named Mateo Tomás. "I already feel an endless love and fierce protection for this boy," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob wrote via Instagram</a> at the time. "Mama Juj was an absolute superhero in the process, and my love and appreciation for her grows more every day."</p><p>Although the parents have chosen not to show photos of Mateo's face, they have still shared about their son and included non-identifying images of him via social media.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@jacobroloff45</span></figure><p>On her first Mother's Day, Isabel took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> to share and reflect on her new title.</p><p>"Being a mom is everything I ever wanted and more," she captioned a photo of herself hugging Mateo, with his back to the camera. "It is waking up completely exhausted and yet so excited for the day ahead. It is planning for a future in a way you never imagined you would. It is (for me) a kick in the butt to get my act together and follow those dreams I have been too afraid to follow — because I would want Mateo to always know he can do ANYTHING he puts his mind to."</p><p>She continued: "Just like my mama told me. It is never ending messes and sometimes headaches and over exertion. But it is also joy and simplicity and the biggest gift I’ve ever been given. I can’t believe Mateo is 5.5 months old! Time please slow down."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Isabel Sofia (@isabelsofiarock)</a></p></figure><p>Unfortunately, Little People, Big World fans won't be seeing Isabel, Jacob, and Mateo on the show — but you can keep up with this branch of the Roloff family <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via Instagram</a>.
