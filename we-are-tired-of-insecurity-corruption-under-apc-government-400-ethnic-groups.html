This is why we note with serious concern some unguarded utterances by political actors across the country, especially with regards to the 2023 general elections,” the ethnic groups said.</p><p>The President-General of NENYLC, Terry Obirh, who spoke on behalf of the organisation during a press briefing in Abuja attended by its Secretary-General, <strong>Oladotun Hassan</strong> and Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Zopmal said, “Our stand is that the Federal Government needs to be more proactive in dealing with the growing spate of insecurity in the country as we cannot continue to witness such mindless killing of Nigerians in their numbers on a daily basis.</p><p>“The main essence and purpose of government is the protection of lives and properties but this appears to have been defeated in Nigeria. On a daily basis, Nigerians are being mowed down and roasted like chickens for no fault of theirs, except the fact that they are Nigerians.</p><p>“We say today that enough is enough and urge the security agencies to sit up. We have heard so many words without action from the government, we have had enough rehearsed condolence messages from the government, what we demand now is an end to the massacre of Nigerians under whatever guise.</p><p>“The council equally took notice of the pervasive corruption in Nigeria. We are concerned about the level of corruption in governance in Nigeria. This has to a large extent impeded development in the country, with resulting infrastructural decay across the country. The humongous annual budget of the country has not in any way translated to development.</p><p>“There are no commensurate development indices vis-a-vis the trillions of naira released every year as capital expenditure. The reason for this gap is not farfetched- it is buried in the graveyard of corruption.</p><p>“Worthy of mention is also our uncompromising position on the need for a united Nigeria, cautioned against inflammatory statements ahead of the 2023 general election.”</p><p>Speaking on the forthcoming 2023 general election, the group said the nation’s electoral body, the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Independent National Electoral Commission</strong></a> has a big role to play.</p><p>“It must give all interested parties equal opportunities in the 2023 general elections to ensure the emergence of credible leaders,” it noted.</p><p>Also speaking, NENYLC organising secretary, <strong>Okwu Nnabuike,</strong> who urged Nigeria youths to participate actively in 2023 politics, called on political actors to be fair to all political zones in elections, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49tZrCdXZa%2FpnnToqmenF2ks261zaycnK2insG6ecKoqautoKm2sLqMrqWdnaJirrGvjKCmr52io7qmutNma2loXZrBqbrInGSgqp%2BqvbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
