In any case, where were they when the nation was tearing down the middle in 2018?! Trying times to be a faithful," said tweeted.<p class=align-left>To join Amollo in objecting to the efforts by the catholic bishops is Nyeri Township MP Ngunjiri Wambugu, who faulted the men of cloth for not being genuine in their pursuit for a truce between Uhuru and Ruto.</p><h2>Wambugu: Stop the dishonesty</h2><p class=align-left>Wambugu generally claimed the church had significantly contributed to the political tension and bad blood between the president and his deputy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/81c04edba4244d67.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gagging Politicians: Vihiga Bishops Ban Leaders from Politicking at Funerals</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This, according to the lawmaker, was hinged on the fact the politicians have turned the pulpit into a playfield where they attack and throw epithets at their apparent critics.</p>"As much as some of the religious leaders seeking to reconcile the two now aren’t personally involved in the reason we are here, the church generally has been the playfield where this hatred has been brewed by providing the platforms and forums where Ruto has mobilised his allies to insult and undermine Uhuru, his boss," he argued.<h2>Take responsibility</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>Jubilee party</a> legislator wondered why the bishops remained silent for long, challenging them to take full responsibility for their action before coming to the reconciliation table.</p>"They didn’t speak out when it happened. Or challenged Ruto to stop it, or correct him. To now seek to reconcile them without first taking responsibility for having to be part of the reason there is a conflict, is not honest," he added. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec94141d169d1c46.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan Newspapers Review: William Ruto Ready for a Handshake with Uhuru Kenyatta</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Further, he claimed<a href=#> calls for UhuRuto to bury the hatchet were not genuine</a>, and only aimed at Ruto's 2022 presidential ambition adding that the DP must first accept he was wrong and apologise to the president.</p>"Ruto first needs to accept that he wronged his Boss. He then needs to humble down and lose his hubris. He should then get off his high horse and publicly apologise to Uhuru. Sincerely and genuinely - not these cheeky statements he makes. And without conditions. And not necessarily expecting to be forgiven. Or be supported in 2022," he said.<p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAkW9scHBdqrW2vtRmqa6sn2K%2FpsHNoqanZZ%2Bptqa6w55kmqWfobmwecCsoqxlk53Cs6%2FHZqOemZSav7R5yp6cqWWfm7NuvM6loK2hk6h6tMDOqWScmaWotq%2BzjJymp56lqLawuo2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
