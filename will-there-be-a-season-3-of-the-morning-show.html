The second season of the hit Apple TV+ program premiered on Sept. 17, 2021, and was quickly lauded by both fans and critics. No mention has been made of a third season since Season 2's release.</p><p>That doesn't mean that it isn't happening, however. The Morning Show has enjoyed solid reviews and viewership ever since it first aired. Couple this with the fact that it has already won a number of prestigious awards, and it's clear fans and critics want more.</p><p>If it were to be announced, it's likely that the third season of The Morning Show would air sometime in late 2022. Currently, the show's cast is led by Jennifer Aniston, who stars as Alex Levy, and Reese Witherspoon, who stars as Alex's new co-host, Bradley Jackson.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Other big names in the series include Nestor Carbonell, Valeria Golino, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, Mark Duplass, Desean Terry, Julianna Margulies, Bel Powley, and Billy Crudup.</p><p>The Morning Show follows Alex Levy, a well-known morning television anchor who ends up caught in a bit of a bad situation. Her on-air anchoring partner, Mitch Kessler, is fired over some pretty damning sexual misconduct allegations, which leaves Alex in a precarious position. The longtime host has to fight to keep her position on the show while simultaneously facing off against her rival, Bradley.</p><p>Seasons 1 and 2 of The Morning Show are currently available for streaming on Apple TV Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnAZqqemaOku25%2FjKidZqyYmnquu9GnoKefXai1sMM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
