As one of the few female alligator hunters featured on Swamp People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley "Deadeye" Jones</a> is a breath of fresh air amid all that testosterone.</p><p>Though the redhead spends most of her time on screen with good friend Ronnie Adams in Louisiana’s Belle River bogs, her home base is actually Mississippi, where she lives with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her husband</a> and three kids.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Ashley "Deadeye" Jones' husband on 'Swamp People'?</h2><p>The TV personality is married to Chad Jones, an attorney in Ridgeland, Miss. According to his firm’s website, the lawyer specializes in "mass tort litigation related to injuries caused by corporations for their profit."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In his bio, Chad explains, "I have handled cases against BP relating to the oil spill, Bayer Pharmaceutical, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and other large corporations… I represent former NFL players [who] have suffered neurocognitive impairment as a result of repetitive brain trauma."</p><p>Ashley credits her husband with helping her out of a deep depression caused by a miscarriage years ago. "It was like I was dead inside. It was like just going through the motions of life without getting anything back from it," she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clarion Ledger</a> in 2019.</p><p>"It was a hormonal imbalance and that's normal, but I didn't have anything I was passionate about to fall back on… I just felt like there was something missing. It was like I was meant to do something else."&nbsp;</p><p>Chad noticed the change in his wife’s demeanor. "I just remember sitting at the kitchen table and my husband said, 'I don't remember the last time I saw you smile, much less laugh,'" Ashley recalled. "He said, 'I'm going to take you deer hunting this afternoon.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That outing ignited a fire inside Ashley that she didn’t know existed. "Some things happen that you don't expect every hunt," she shared. "There's always a new lesson to be learned."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ashley and Chad met 'Swamp People' co-star Ronnie on a hog hunt.</h2><p>For fans wondering how Ashley transitioned from deer to gators, she has Facebook to thank for her stint on reality TV. The fishing enthusiast connected with Ronnie on the platform and signed up for one of his wild hog hunts in New Orleans.</p><p>"[Chad and I] went down there and hog-hunted and really got along [with Ronnie]," Ashley told the Clarion Ledger. "He's the kind of person that when you meet him the first time, you're like family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ronnie was so impressed with Ashley’s skills — her nickname "Deadeye" stems from her impeccable shot — that he recommended her for Swamp People when producers came knocking. "I watched the show religiously and never in a million years ... thought I would be on it… ever," she admitted.</p><p>New episodes of Swamp People air Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST on the History Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCpuMSyZJ2dkZmyurGMo6annaNitba%2FwZqlnWWjrK6uvIypnKionJo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
