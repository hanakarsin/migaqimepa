Guests were each given $1,000 to tip BOLO, who Kenya alleges slept with not one, but two of the housewives ‚Äî <a href=#>Tanya Sam</a> and <a href=#>Porsha Williams</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>While unconfirmed, Kenya says that a threesome occurred between the housewives and BOLO, a suspicion that she says was confirmed by the noises she and Marlo Hampton heard coming from the entertainer‚Äôs bedroom. In a confessional, Kenya revealed, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not enough holy water or sage in the world to erase what went down in this house. Someone screwed the stripper. It wasn‚Äôt me, but I‚Äôm going to find out who did it.‚Äù</p><p>Kenya went on, ‚ÄúSix a.m., I was up, went downstairs. No one was in the living room. And I could hear noises. Moans and groans, and I heard voices coming from the hallway. I'm like, 'Are you serious?
