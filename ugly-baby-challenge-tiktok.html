Unlike other social media trends that put immense pressure on young moms to comply with unrealistic expectations, this one encourages them to focus on the unexpected aspects of motherhood and embrace the surprise twists they didn't see coming. Here's what you should know about the TikTok trend.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Ugly Baby Challenge is all about adorable babies who look a bit unconventional.</h2><p>The Ugly Baby Challenge encourages moms to share humorous clips about their newborn babies.</p><p>Lucy Baehr, an Arkansas-based lifestyle photographer, found fame overnight thanks to the trend. On July 11, 2021, she posted a short clip caricaturing the sharp discrepancy between what she expected her daughter to look like and, well, what she actually looked like.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Her TikTok clip struck a chord with new moms and other TikTok users. The first few frames show Lucy still pregnant, while the second part of the video is all about her youngest daughter, Reese. A heart-melting baby, Reese has a big nose, large, round-shaped eyes, and adorable spindly legs. As Lucy told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KARK.com</a>, she didn't look like what she thought she would — but that's OK.</p><p>"This trend started where people were saying, 'We thought our newborn was going to be so cute, and they were not.' I was like, 'I win! I win! I win this," Lucy Baehr said. "I'm pretty sure I looked at my husband and was like, 'She's healthy?'"</p><p>As she added, her daughter, Harper, noticed something strange about Reese too.</p><p>"Even Harper, when she held [Reese] for the first time, she looked up at me and said, 'She kind of looks weird, doesn't she?' and I was like, 'Um, you're not wrong?'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lucybaehr href=#>@lucybaehr</a><p>She’s had quite the glowup <a title=DontSpillChallenge href=#>#DontSpillChallenge</a> <a title=wholesome href=#>#wholesome</a> <a title=babiesoftiktok href=#>#babiesoftiktok</a> <a title=newborn href=#>#newborn</a></p><a title="♬ chicken tikka - han" href=#>♬ chicken tikka - han</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Over the past few weeks, Lucy's clip has been viewed over 24.1 million times. It didn't take long for TikTokers to swarm the comment section, with many sharing their honest opinions about the tiny (and adorable!!!) baby.</p><p>"I can't explain, but I'm getting clam vibes from her," wrote Sadie (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@aloha.sadie</a>).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Ugly Baby Challenge turned out to be a real hit among new moms.</h2><p>Other TikTokers to respond to the Ugly Baby Challenge include Boss Baby (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@bossbabysunshine</a>), Liz B (@lizzyb917), Sarah Beeston (@sarbeeston), and many others.
