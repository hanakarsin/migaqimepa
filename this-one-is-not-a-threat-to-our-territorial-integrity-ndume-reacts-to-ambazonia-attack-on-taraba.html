I have listened to the governor, this is more of communal or tribal conflict that affect communities along our borders,” he said.</p><p>“You know the borders of Nigeria and Cameroon stretches from Taraba and even down to Cross River, up to Borno in my local government — Gwoza LGA.</p><p>“We have several villages and towns across the borders and mostly it is divided by rivers and you can see that the Manga village is a resettled resettlement from the location of the dam construction.</p><p>“As the governor said, the details are not yet out. This kind of communal clashes between tribes and communities happen not frequently but it can happen especially these days.</p><p>“Basically, economic and sometimes political reasons, in rare cases, even religious.</p><p>“This one is not a threat to our territorial integrity. What I’m suspecting, because the reports are not clearly out, is more of a communal clash.</p><p>“What I’m saying is that security to every Nigerian is a constitutional matter and in fact it is the main purpose of the government but that is not to say Cameroon or Ambazonia you called them are threatening Nigeria.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye5ByZq2gmah6sLrEZqCsZZ6kwW6tjK2fq52RqXq1u4yorKtlpJq%2Fs7XTqKmimZxitq%2FAxKCpoqypYrulwcyeZKudkZjBtHnTqGSapZKWx7C6yJpkmqyklrCsec6nZK2Zopavons%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
