The conservative political commentator revealed she was leaving OAN after working for the network for the past five years — and in doing so, the 31-year-old mentioned she already has another prospect lined up. But what is Liz's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">new job</a>?</p><p>If you're not familiar with OAN, don't feel too out of the loop. The cable news channel has relatively low viewership and ratings, and is known to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promote conspiracy theories</a>. OAN also has a reputation for being a blatantly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pro-Trump network</a>. Additionally, the POTUS has praised the far-right news outlet as a better alternative to Fox, and he frequently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">re-tweets its content</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Liz Wheeler/YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Liz Wheeler announced in September that she was leaving One America News Network.</h2><p>Liz announced her departure from OAN on Sept. 11 after having worked for the network since 2015.</p><p>"Launching and growing Tipping Point has been the opportunity of a lifetime," she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Examiner</a>. "I am so thankful for my time at One America News and, most importantly, I am so thankful for all of the incredible people across the country who grew with me, learned with me, and trusted me to bring them the news each and every night."</p><p>That same day, Liz published a video titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Why I'm Leaving One America News"</a> to her newly-launched YouTube channel. "One America News has been a wonderful place to grow, but now it's time for something new. It's time for me to move onto something even bigger and better. I am so excited to share what's next for me," she said in the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Big announcement!
