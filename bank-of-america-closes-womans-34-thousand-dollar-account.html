That's what a TikToker who goes by Nena (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@quezada903</a>) on the popular social media platform says happened with Bank of America.</p><p>In a now-viral clip, Nena records her interaction with a BoA employee. The video displays a text overlay that reads: "Bank of America closed my account with $34,000 in it and sent me a fake cashiers check."</p><p>A separate overlay continued, "3 of their banks wouldn't cash it. I was instructed by the manager to deposit it into another financial institution."</p><p>The overlay continued, "When I did BOA wouldn't pay. I got hit with a return check fee and no one knows where my money is."</p><p>Nena can be heard saying in the video, "So you called and nobody's able to give you any answers as to where this money is?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@quezada239 href=#>@quezada239</a><p>I need answers BOA. Where is my money and why is this happening???</p><a title="♬ original sound - Nena" href=#>♬ original sound - Nena</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>The employee responds, "They, I followed the check, you know, they closed the account, they issued the check, they mailed it out, I said but they're not honoring it at the other bank, and they said, and then I said well is there a stop payment on it why wouldn't it be honored? And they're like it hasn't come back to them yet."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>The Bank of America worker then said, "So they've escalated it further," before asking the customer, "When are they not honoring it? Just today?"</p><p>"Oh yeah," Nena replies.</p><p>"OK so they probably haven't talked with them yet."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>Nena understandably pushed the issue, as it's a case of a missing $34,000. "Well Bank of America didn't honor it they returned the check."</p><p>The employee said, "Bank of America they'll reach out and speak with each other, they'll give you an answer as to why we didn't honor it. Wherever you - Suncoast or whatever."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>The TikToker tells the woman that they did inform her as to why they didn't honor the check, however, "They did, they said that the only answer was that you guys weren't honoring the check."</p><p>"And for what reason?" the employee asks.</p><p>"That was that code you used, CF."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>The worker tells Nena she doesn't know what code she's referring to: "Yeah and I don't know what that code is..." she then asks Nena to speak to the other branch to ask them what that code means.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>Nena documented follow-up interactions with the Bank of America employee and the most recent video she posted to her TikTok says that she was ultimately able to escalate the situation and that Bank of America informed her that they were experiencing a computer glitch and they were re-issuing her a check.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @quezada329</span></figure><p>It turns out that Nena isn't the only Bank of America customer that this has happened to. She posted a screen recording of a news story where another man with some $33,000 in his own account who experienced "panic" after he was unable to access his funds.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@quezada239 href=#>@quezada239</a><p>@Bank of America</p><a title="♬ original sound - Nena" href=#>♬ original sound - Nena</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @quezada239</span></figure><p>She dedicated her account to sharing other instances where more bank customers suddenly lost their money.
