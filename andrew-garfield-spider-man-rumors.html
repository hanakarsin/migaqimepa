Andrew laughed off the photo and asked Jimmy, "What are you talking about?"</p><p>He then said he had seen the photo Jimmy was referring to, but claimed, "It's a Photoshop."</p><p>Although no one â€” including Jimmy â€” seemed convinced, Andrew stuck to his guns.</p><p>"I'm trying to manage expectations," Andrew added.
