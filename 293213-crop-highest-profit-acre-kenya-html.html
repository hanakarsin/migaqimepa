Kenya has a pleasant climate for many crops and enough land and water to grow. Whether a small-scale or large-scale farmer, there is an opportunity to make good money when venturing into certain crops. The most profitable crops per acre do not require massive land, just a small plot enough to grow and produce the crop.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/12a53bedd6456005.jpeg><p class=align-left>When going for high-value crops, consider the cost of production compared to yields. Extensive research should be done, especially regarding the crops grown in your area and the current market price of the produce.</p><h2>Most profitable crops per acre</h2><p class=align-left>Before settling on a particular crop, consider your needs and the required effort. Invest in quality inputs like fertilizer to get quality produce. As you consult farmers and suppliers, good quality seeds should be the next step. Here is a list of the best crop to grow on 5 acres:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/743da5c65ddc0053.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Garlic farming profit per acre in Kenya: Is it a worthy venture?</span></p></a><h3>1. Pineapples</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/743da5c65ddc0053.jpeg><p class=align-left>Pineapples are not just one of the sweetest crops in Kenya but also the most profitable. The country's <a href=#>climate</a> favours the growth of this crop, with areas like the Coastal region being the best to grow pineapples.</p><p class=align-left>Pineapples in <a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a> are loved for their vibrant colour, nutritional value, and taste. One major advantage of growing this crop is that there is ready and consistent market demand. If you play your cards right, you will not only be selling locally but internationally as well.</p><h3>2. Dragon fruit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/5b9d0cd3113b85d6.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is a fairly new crop for Kenyan farmers. They are classified as vines of the cactus <a href=#>family</a>. With just an acre, you can have about 1000 support posts with two vines planted, thus making an acre enough to plant 2000 dragon fruits. The average mature dragon fruit weighs about 500 grams.</p><p class=align-left>Dragon fruits are not cheap, and being a new crop in the country, only a few farmers have tried growing them. Most <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/guides/516265-dragon-fruit-farming-kenya-cost-yield-profit-acre/ href=#>dragon fruits</a> sold in grocery stores and supermarkets in Kenya are imported. Thus, this is a great opportunity for you as a local farmer to venture into the business.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9314ff693bf4ad8d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many Hass avocado trees per acre in Kenya?

Passion fruit</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/9cd0707a1cad6061.jpeg><p class=align-left>Passion fruit is your answer if you're looking for a low-maintenance crop that you can intercrop while farming. You are also assured of high yields and a ready market from juice-producing companies and startups. You can harvest up to 50,000 kilograms of passion fruits in one hectare.</p><p class=align-left>Another amazing thing about this crop is that the fruits do not ripen all at once. Some passion fruits ripen within three days of harvest, while others take more than a week. This is an advantage to farmers as it allows them to harvest every week without everything going bad.</p><h3>4. Strawberries</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9314ff693bf4ad8d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Think of any beverage or soft drink you like and a strawberry flavour is made. Strawberry farming is not new to Kenya, but many companies producing Strawberry-flavoured products often go for imported strawberries.</p><p class=align-left>This is unfortunate because strawberries can grow in every part of Kenya with a constant water or rain supply. The beauty of strawberries is that you do not need a massive piece of land to grow them. Once mature, a quarter acre or less can give you about 40 kilograms of strawberries.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b940ea17aed6aa51.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Neptune F1 onion yield per acre and farming costs in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The crop's maturity takes<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> two to three months</a>, given the plants are well taken care of. Harvesting of the first batch happens fast, so agribusiness experts advise that farmers look for a market immediately after planting the crop.</p><h3>5. Macadamia</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/fdf343ad27c76b12.jpeg><p class=align-left>Macadamia farming is profitable, provided you understand the market. The nuts have a demand and give huge yields once matured. With a yield of 3 tons per acre, you can make as much as 600,000 Kenya shillings. The current market for macadamia nuts is 200,000 Kenya shillings.</p><h3>6. Offseason Mangoes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/1dce74e8b585a1a5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Some farmers may not prefer seasonal fruits, but how many people have ever considered off-season mangoes? Seasonal mangoes do well, but there is also potential in off-season mangoes. The trick about these mangoes is planting high-quality varieties.</p><p class=align-left>Avoid mangoes that have more fibre than edible flesh and stick to quality. Also, the timing when planting is crucial. Choose to plant when you know that the off-season mangoes will have matured once the ordinary variety is unavailable in the market.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/674ffb63b43decb5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 types of kale that you'll want to grow in Kenya (pictures)</span></p></a><h3>7. Onions</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b940ea17aed6aa51.jpeg><p class=align-left>Everyone has their opinion on onions, but farmers who have mastered the crop will tell you it is one of the most profitable crops per acre. With everything required in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">onion farming</a> considered, you can harvest about 25 kilograms of onions in an acre.</p><p class=align-left>The cost of production may have discouraged some farmers, but current prices of onion in the market are a reason for one to venture into farming this crop. You can harvest 20-30 tons of onions with a good farm.</p><h3>8. Mushrooms</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/4c01f9fa6e901c73.jpeg><p class=align-left>Not every Kenyan is a regular consumer of mushrooms, but this is the crop with the highest profit per acre in Kenya. Exotic mushrooms like oysters and shiitake are especially profitable as they do not require soil to grow.</p><p class=align-left>With the perfect temperature, water and lighting, you can grow your mushrooms indoors and enjoy the proceeds with little effort. Agricultural wastes like <a href=#>beans</a> stalks, coffee husks, maize stalks, and paper waste are what most farmers use to grow the mushrooms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/503d7b8f74917dab.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Profitable 3 months crops in Kenya to grow during short rains</span></p></a><h3>9. Snow Peas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/e174b7594ddb230c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Some farmers focus on export crops, and if you are among the bunch, then snow peas are a good try. Committed farmers have an average yield of 2 tons per acre, provided the growing conditions are excellent.</p><p class=align-left>A single ton of snow peas ranges between Ksh 250,000 and Ksh 280,000. With that in mind, an acre can get you about Ksh 500,000 in one harvest. This is among the most profitable farming in Kenya.</p><h3>10. Pawpaws</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/674ffb63b43decb5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Pawpaws are a favourable crop for many as they thrive even in semi-arid areas. They require little rain to grow and are rarely affected by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pests and diseases</a>. Pawpaws require little effort and time and thus are great for farmers who want to handle multiple projects simultaneously.</p><p class=align-left>Pawpaws come in a dozen varieties, which is promising as farmers can choose the best variety that suits them. With just an acre, you can plant 1000 pawpaw trees. This acre can give you 50 tons of fruits upon maturity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/126ffa5d2b7b43ab.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many bags of maize per acre in Kenya?

Kales</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/b95c9e796e120073.jpeg><p class=align-left>Kales are another crop that is easy to plant and equally easy to harvest. The other advantage is that you do not need a big piece of land, as a small garden can produce enough kale for home consumption and selling.</p><p class=align-left>If you have an acre, you can harvest about 25 tons. A singleton ranges between Ksh 40,000 to Ksh 50,000, which is quite profitable. Consider kale to be the most profitable vegetable to grow in Kenya.</p><h3>12. Wheat</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/df19f4701420861a.jpeg><p class=align-left>Like maize, wheat is massively consumed in Kenya, which is one of the major reasons farmers are encouraged to grow the crop. A farmer is assured of nothing less than 20 100-kilogram bags per acre of wheat.</p><p class=align-left>Wheat flour is used to make baked foods like bread and cake and prepare Kenya's favourite Chaptis. Wheat has dozens of nutrients like B vitamins, dietary fibre, and phytochemicals, and the waste can be used to feed <a href=#>dairy animals</a> and chicken.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/39b791b5e4d5f367.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Legumes types that are grown in Kenya with market prices</span></p></a><h3>13. Carrots</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/503d7b8f74917dab.jpeg><p class=align-left>Carrot farming is done best in wet areas. This is because the roots are sensitive to high temperatures. In addition, farmers should also consider the type of soil when planting. Loam soil is the best soil, as poorly drained soil provides room for bacteria growth.</p><p class=align-left>Carrots mature within 3 to 4 months, so you can consider carrots if you want 3 months' crops. With an acre, you can harvest between 20 to 25 tons. Different varieties can slightly change the amount of harvest and profit margins.</p><h3>14. Garlic</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/1790b2306951a9ba.jpeg><p class=align-left>Talk of lucrative businesses in Kenya, and you have garlic farming. Apart from its health and medicinal purposes, garlic is considered one of the most profitable crops per acre, whether you are a newbie or a seasoned farmer.</p><p class=align-left>In Kenya, garlic grows best in humid areas with low temperatures and moderate rainfall. The soil should also be fertile, light and well-drained. Garlic farming profit per acre in Kenya is 4,000 to 5,000 kilograms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1af0277b58a81378.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many cabbages per acre in Kenya and the cost of farming</span></p></a><h3>15. French beans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/3958383e8fef5a8b.jpeg><p class=align-left>French beans mature between 50 to 60 days. This is one of the most profitable vegetables to grow in Kenya. An acre can produce 7 to 9 tons of <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/guides/508620-french-beans-farming-kenya-guide-earnings-acre/ href=#>French beans</a>. The trick about growing this crop is to plant every week. Maturity happens faster, and it is a readily available market.</p><h3>16. Pumpkin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/126ffa5d2b7b43ab.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ever thought of pumpkin profit per acre in Kenya? This is another crop that will bring you more money than expected. When planting the seeds, prepare mounds of soil for the sun's heat to pierce through and to help increase drainage.</p><p class=align-left>Another thing to keep in mind is the birds. Ensure that birds cannot dig through to get to the seeds by placing them at least two inches deep. With considerable spacing, you can harvest 5 tons per acre upon maturity.</p><h3>17. Coffee</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/69a60c73bcd2c571.jpeg><p class=align-left>For the longest time, coffee has been a <a href=#>profitable business</a> in Kenya. Small and large-scale farmers make good margins for coffee profits. One can harvest as much as 1.5 to 2 tons of coffee for an acre. Suitable soil and fertilizer are factors to consider before starting coffee farming.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/da6f341556977018.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of mushrooms that are edible in Kenya (with pictures)</span></p></a><h3>18. Sweet potato</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/230ba640b27f14dd.jpeg><p class=align-left>Creeping crops in Kenya, like Sweet Potatoes, do well for small-scale farmers in agribusiness. The amount of bags harvested measures the success of sweet potatoes. A good yield will give you 40 100 kg bags of sweet potatoes per acre.</p><p class=align-left>Sweet potatoes take 4 to 7 months to mature, depending on factors like variety. Commercial production of sweet potatoes is one of the many ways young modern farmers make that extra cash.</p><h3>19. Hass Avocado</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/39b791b5e4d5f367.jpeg><p class=align-left>Unlike regular Avocado, Hass Avocado is preferred for its richer taste and creamier texture. About 150 avocado trees can be planted on an acre. An acre will give you 400 kilograms of avocado within three years of planting.</p><p class=align-left>Hass avocados in Kenya are mostly planted for export, though you can get a local market if you consult in your area. Kenya is the largest exporter of hass avocados in Africa, with the main <a id=https://east-fruit.com/en/horticultural-business/interviews/harvest-season-for-hass-avocado-has-begun-in-kenya-exclusive-interview-with-industry-expert/# href=# rel="nofollow noopener">export markets</a> being in the Netherlands, France, Spain, the UK, and Germany.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b71caa4bb6db8d74.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How China is responding to economic challenges</span></p></a><h3>20.

The best thing about crops like cucumber is that you do not need open fields to grow them, as greenhouses can do the job. Cucumbers take about 60 days to be ready for harvest.</p><p class=align-left>A tip when harvesting cucumbers is to never wait for the crops to fully mature. Harvesting is done before full maturity. Cucumbers harvested after they attain the yellow colour sometimes form a bitter taste.</p><h2>Most profitable crops per acre - Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Like in every business, agribusiness entrepreneurs looking to plant the most profitable crops per acre are advised to start small. Good results may take time and persistence, but they are worth it. Before settling on a particular crop, consider your needs and the required effort. Invest in quality inputs like fertilizer, and you will get quality crops.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared a guide about plants that <a id=https://www.tuko.co.ke/facts-lifehacks/guides/507547-list-plants-grow-dry-areas-kenya-uses/ href=#>grow in dry areas</a> in Kenya with their uses. Dry and semi-arid regions have weather conditions that hinder plant development. However, some plants survive in dry environments.</p><p class=align-left>When choosing the type of plants to plant on a piece of land, climate is the most important thing you should consider. Drought-resistant plants grow in locations with little rain.
