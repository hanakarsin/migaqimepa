It was the first car she ever bought for herself; she was 17 years old.</p><p>So even though the car was in rough shape, it held immense sentimental value for Bonet. Her husband (with the help of a very cool, professional auto shop, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine One Customs</a>) restored the car completely, from the inside out. And he released a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> to bring us along on the journey too.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>In the video, you learn that this car is actually super rare and had lots of custom parts. It's unclear how many of those parts were salvageable, but the auto shop did the best they could to preserve the character of the car.</p><p>Whether you're a "car person" or not, it's extremely cool to get a behind-the-scenes glance at everything that goes into restoring a car. You see the mechanics literally take it apart piece by piece until it's down to the skeleton, clean what they can, and then put the whole thing back together again, with some very special new and exciting details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>On the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine One Customs website</a>, they explain the full extent of the work they put into this car. They did a full restoration, which included paint and body, wheels and tires, trim, custom paint and design, and more. The interior was also completely torn out and redone with custom upholstery, embroidery, color, leather, suede, and more.</p><p>Other elements included custom metal, wood, and composite body modifications within the car. And last but not least, they added high-end car audio equipment. Needless to say, they nailed it, and Jason Momoa was blown away when it was done. He couldn't wait to show it to Lisa for the first time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On Instagram</a>, Jason wrote that this surprise project was 14 years in the making. He wrote, "I wanted to surprise my wife with her first car she ever bought and bring it back to life and into our family. Mahalo to @bigkemdizel for bringing me to @divine1customs to meet Misha, I could not have done this without the love and support they put into this project."</p><p>He decided to make a video project to document the restoration with his production company, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Roam</a>. The result is a romantic love letter to this legendary car and the legendary couple and family that owns it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Lisa's reaction when she sees the car for the first time is priceless. It clearly means a lot to her that Jason went through all the trouble to restore the whole thing, and she's clearly excited to share her first car with him and their kids in a way they haven't been able to up until now.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Watch the whole video on YouTube, feel the love, and maybe go for a drive afterward. Believe me; you're going to want to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mpKilkWK5qr%2FAZpmoppWpeq7B0q2Yp58%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
