It is never a crime to call for self-determination, thus, he should be freed. Biafrans have to put away their differences and make sure he comes out. When I was in detention, Igbo came together to bring me out. Nnamdi has done tremendously well and has shown resoluteness in the Biafra struggle. Our goal is our independence and the good of our people.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Asari Dokubo speaks about Biafra name</p><p><i>''IPOB should extend their campaign to every region in Biafraland and not just Igboland. The Biafra gospel should be preached everywhere and people should be told why they should fearlessly join in this movement.”</i></p><p><i>“It is our collective responsibilities that will make Biafra restoration a success.</i></p><p><i>“The Biafra struggle is for everyone and no one can do it all alone, thus, everyone should do away with differences and come together to make sure Kanu is freed and Biafra is restored. Leadership should not be our interest now; everyone should focus on our goal, which is the restoration of the sovereign state of Biafra.</i></p><p><i>“Any Biafran who wants to deny the fact that Kanu catalysed this quest for Biafra independence is lying to himself; it is an obvious truth.</i></p><p><i>“This is not time to nurse grudges against one another so that our enemies will not take advantage of it and then use it against us.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Unbelievable! Read what soldiers did to vendors of Biafra newspapers</p><p><i>“I urge every Biafran to be strong and also call for the release of our brother, Kanu.”</i></p><p>However, Legit.ng cannot independently verify this message.</p><p>The former Niger Delta warlord recently explained the origin of Biafra saying that the name of the movement is Ijaw and not Ibo. This is contrary to the general belief.</p><p>Asari Dokubo expressed his support for the movement earlier saying that his group shares the same vision with the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHeDlW9tZqORo8Juw8ilo2aeopqypXnBopifqpFiv6a%2F06ipnpxdlsCivshmm6ijpZe8br%2FEp5usZaOpv7C6xmaknqujlrSmecGun5qqmWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
