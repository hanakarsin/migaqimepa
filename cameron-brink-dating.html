She was set to play for the United States in the <a href=#>2024 Summer Olympics</a> when an ACL tear ended her season and her 2024 Olympic aspirations. Luckily, she has a solid support system between her friends, family, and the guy she‚Äôs been dating for over three years.</p><p>After graduating from Stanford in 2024, Cameron was the second <a href=#>WNBA draft pick</a> (after <a href=#>Caitlin Clark</a>), drafted by the Los Angeles Sparks. And in June, she learned she was selected to play for the USA on the Women‚Äôs 3x3 team. As the news circulates of her replacement, Dearica Hamby, Caitlin‚Äôs fans are grateful that her boyfriend, <a href=#>Ben Felter</a>, is by her side.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@cameronbrink22</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cameron Brink has been dating fellow Stanford athlete Ben Felter for over three years.</h2><p>While it‚Äôs rare for college relationships to blossom into forever partners, it seems like Cameron and Ben are in it for the long haul. The two officially started dating in March 2021, when they were both in their early years at Stanford. Cameron was already a star athlete on the basketball team and Ben was on the rowing team.</p><p>As Cameron rose to fame in the college basketball world, she and Ben managed to keep their relationship relatively private. Ben comments on several of Cameron‚Äôs posts with support, and they‚Äôve shared sporadic posts honoring one another on Instagram for milestones like anniversaries and birthdays. But for the most part, we know very little about the ins and outs of their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ùêÇ (@cameronbrink22)</a></p></figure><p>One thing we do know, however, is that they love doing fun activities together. ‚ÄúMy boyfriend has turned me into a huge art lover," Cameron told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "I love pottery and watercolor, even though I'm terrible. It's really lovely to just sit down and work your brain in a different way for a little bit.‚Äù</p><p>In their posts together, they‚Äôve shared pics of spending time in the outdoors, surfing, hiking, sharing date nights, going swimming, riding scooters, spending time with family, and more. In Cameron‚Äôs first post since her ACL surgery, she took a mirror selfie with Ben and added the caption: ‚ÄúSo much change, yet so much joy.‚Äù The ‚Äújoy‚Äù however, is likely a reference to a seemingly new addition to their home ‚Äî an adorable pup!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ben Felter (@ben_da_felta)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Ben Felter was a college athlete who is now working towards his master's degree.</h2><p>According to Ben‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, he enrolled in a master's program at Stanford immediately after finishing his bachelor‚Äôs degree in computer science. Based on his internships and resume, Ben seems to be looking toward a future in AI. He‚Äôs currently a technical intern at the Defense Innovation Unit in the Space Portfolio sect, as well as a researcher for the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p><p>His 2025 master‚Äôs degree is set to be in computer science with a concentration in artificial intelligence, which we all know is on the rise. Between Cameron‚Äôs basketball talent and Ben‚Äôs dedication to a rising field, they‚Äôre set to be one of Gen Z‚Äôs greatest power couples. A comment on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben‚Äôs three-year anniversary post</a> even described them as ‚ÄúBarbie and Ken: athlete edition.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ben Felter (@ben_da_felta)</a></p></figure><p>So for the public who‚Äôs been crushing on Cameron since she rose to basketball stardom, it seems her relationship with Ben is here to stay. Friends who have known them throughout the years have been supportive of their relationship on public media, so from our perspective, Cameron has already found her perfect match.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6usdGopWaaop67rHnDmquippc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
