Her cause of death was not immediately released to the public, but a few days after her passing, it was announced that she had died after suffering from a brain aneurysm a few days before her death.</p><p>Her passing came as a complete shock to many considering she was only 55 years old and seemingly in good health before all of this. Tyler first hinted that something was wrong when he canceled his highly-anticipated and promoted Good Morning America appearance on Friday, Feb. 28, 2020.</p><p>"Have to cancel GMA group run tomorrow. Family emergency. Please pray for my mom and my family," he wrote on Twitter on Thursday, Feb. 27, 2020.</p><p>We do know that the two were very close, as Tyler has gushed about his mother in the past via Instagram. In early November of 2019, he shared a series of sweet photos of Andrea hugging and smiling with him after he completed the NYC Marathon.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Have to cancel GMA group run tomorrow.

Couldn’t have done this race without all of y’all. So thankful for all of the support," he wrote at the time.</p><p>His mother also supported him while he was on The Bachelorette, and she continued to watch the show until her death. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last Instagram post</a> is of her and her dog watching The Bachelor. "Here we go Peter....... my pick is Maddy!" she captioned the photo on the social media platform.</p><p>Andrea was a real estate agent in Jupiter, Fla. at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Keyes Company</a> at the time of her passing, but she also prided herself on "being a blessed mom of three great men," according to her Instagram bio.</p><p>Andrea and Tyler's dad, <a href=#>Jeff Cameron</a>, divorced when Tyler was young. They're also parents to two additional sons, Austin and Ryan. Ryan currently plays football at Florida Atlantic University, and Austin is in the military at Fort Knox, Ky.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>So grateful for all of the support that I got from my family, friends, and BN!

Before he appeared on the ABC hit reality show, he nearly lost his father after he battled some serious health issues. Jeff now has a paralyzed vocal cord, but even though he was still healing and recovering from the near-death situation while Tyler was away filming, he's the one who encouraged his son to be on the show.</p><p>“Me and my dad would sit around and watch The Bachelorette and he kind of became a huge fan of you,” he revealed to Hannah on one of their first dates.
