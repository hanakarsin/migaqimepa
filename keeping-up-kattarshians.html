But one things for sure: people really do love their reality TV shows. And when it comes to reality, oddly enough, Keeping Up With The Kardashians still manages to stay relevant and popular. I don't get the appeal of watching a bunch of rich people become even more rich without discernible talents, but maybe that's the point?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But "Keeping up with the Kattarshians" is one reality show I think I could really get into.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>It's a reality TV show filmed in Iceland where a bunch of kittens share life in a doll house that's been rigged with a bunch of hidden cameras.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The cats are all named after the Kardashian gang, (Kylie, Khloe, Kim and the rest) and the show was created in conjunction with the Icelandic Cat Protection Society.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><p>The producers are taking the cat's health and safety very seriously. Inga Lind Karlsd√≥ttir came up with the pun-tacular show idea and said that she came up with the idea over a year ago and the reason why it took so long to bring to life is because her and her team were working so closely with animal protection agencies.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Inga says that the initial response to the show has been "tremendous."</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure>"It took about a year to put together, because we wanted all the animal welfare authorities to approve it," she said. "And here we are, a year later, with the first reality TV show starring kittens. All the people who were laughing then aren't laughing now. &nbsp;We like everything they do. It's fun when they go crazy and ruin the house, but it's also calming to watch them sleep. It's good for the soul."<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some are questioning why anyone would want a cat reality show, but Inga thinks now's the perfect time for more cats on the internet.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>View post on imgur.com</a></figure><p>"It's nice to sit there and relax and watch kittehs," with all that's going on in the world.&nbsp;Plus she says it's great for people who are allergic to cats: "But 'Keeping Up With The Kattarshians' is great for people with allergies. You can just sit there and watch the cats on your computer screen."
