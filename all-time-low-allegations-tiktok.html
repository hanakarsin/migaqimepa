The band has been in the spotlight since 2003, and in the roughly two decades since they formed, they have released a slew of successful singles and albums that have solidified their status in the music industry.</p><p>Successes as a group aside, All Time Low has been in the spotlight recently for something far removed from music: allegations of sexual misconduct, which have largely stemmed from a viral <a href=#>TikTok</a>. So, what exactly are the details surrounding the allegations made against All Time Low? Here's a breakdown of all of the known facts.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Allegations against All Time Low came in the form of a TikTok video.</h2><p>Like many viral moments on the internet today, the claims made against All Time Low stemmed from a single <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since-deleted TikTok</a>. In that video, an unnamed woman alluded to a band (which was later determined by internet sleuths to be All Time Low) that invited her on their tour bus when she was only 13 years old.</p><p>That video did not specify exactly what the band did, but in alleged screen shots from the comments section, the woman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a>: "They literally tried to take my bra for their nasty collection and offered me beers. They got my friend's phone number and prank called her for months." She also gave <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hints</a> about which band she was referring to: "They're not even that punk, they write songs about champagne and kids."</p><p>On Oct. 25, 2021, an anonymous woman's story was posted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, in which she accused the group's guitarist, Jack Barakat, of sexual assault when she was a minor, beginning in 2011 when she was just 15 years old.</p><p>She claimed in the since-deleted thread that the abuse began on the band's 2011 tour and continued for years. She even added that in 2016 another band member witnessed her being assaulted by Jack and did nothing.</p><p>"I now realize that I was being manipulated by a man who groomed me during a time when I was an emotionally vulnerable child," she wrote in the deleted tweets. The woman also mentioned that the incidents in question involved drugs and were later in life a root cause of eating disorders, mental anguish, and suicide attempts that she dealt with over the years.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A statement from the four of us. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tazxZAKOkr</a></p>â€” All Time Low (@AllTimeLow) <a href=#>October 25, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">All Time Low issued a statement in response to the damning allegations levied against them.</h2><p>In a statement posted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> on Oct. 25, 2021, all four members of the band explained their side of the story and vehemently denied any allegations of wrongdoing on their part.</p><p>"When a TikTok video gained traction a few weeks ago alluding to inappropriate behavior within our camp, we chose not to respond because of the glaring inconsistencies in the story and the apparent reluctance to mention us by name," the band said.</p><p>They added, "We felt that a response would have elevated and escalated an outright lie, and in doing so, robbed actual victims of abuse of their very real and very important collective voice."</p><p>All Time Low stated that the allegations are "completely and utterly false." Beyond that, they mentioned that they want their shows to be "welcoming, healthy, and safe" environments, but noted that they'd be investigating the source of the "false" allegations and seeking legal action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmtedOipJ5lnKTEbq3LpZygmaSevK%2B%2FjK2gpKyfoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
