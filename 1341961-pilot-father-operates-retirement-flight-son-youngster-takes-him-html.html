After that, my license will no longer be valid. I am flying with my son. Right now I feel like I am passing on the baton and Indeed I am. Every parent wishes that their children will grow to exceed them. That is what I want for my son...to exceed me. I want him to receive every piece of ability within me...It should all go to him," said Maranga shortly before he flew cargo flight KQ 2319 to Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/8a62117f3bab3020.jpeg><p class=align-left>The pilot said his urge to become a pilot began burning within him while he was still a young boy back in his village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/5207465162fc5e4b.jpeg><p class=align-left>He was attracted to planes every time he saw a light aircraft belonging to a farmer fly above their village.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/07fbda9ee8fff2d8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Owing to his love for aeroplane, his father nicknamed him Peter Mweria. Mweria was the farmer who owned the small plane.</p>"I was about three or four years old when I became fascinated with planes and flying. There was a small aircraft that used to pass above our village and my father told me it belonged to a farmer called Peter Mweria.My father called me Peter Mweria. This validated my dream of being a pilot. That gave me the energy, strength and belief that I could do it," said Maranga.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/7b32aca747a9f5aa.jpeg><p class=align-left>His son Emmanuel said his greatest experience in the flight deck was the privilege of being able to fly and gain experience under the tutelage of his father.</p>"I am very happy and grateful for this chance...to be able to fly with him today on his last flight... I can't wait," said Emmanuel who flies the B787 fleet.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/97f449be73787cdf.jpeg><p class=align-left>The pilot's daughter, Dawn Maranga, described her father as an indomitable man who never gives up on anything he embarks on doing.</p>"It is one trait that he has always portrayed since I was a kid until today when I am an adult," said Dawn.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/802e63288488ff00.jpeg><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnSAkHJtamWgnrmwwIyfmK2glad6sLzEq5itnaNiv6bAyKucpp2eqXqnuMign61lo6S7bsXOrqWgq6Sav27AwKScrGWYnrpvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 PulseVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
